It is the site where, according to Philip Melanchthon, the Ninety-five Theses were posted by Martin Luther in 1517, launching the beginning of the Protestant Reformation.
Beginning in 1883, the church was restored as a memorial site and re-inaugurated on 31 October 1892, 375 years after Luther's posting. Because of its religious significance and testimony to the lasting global effects of the Reformation, the church was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1996 along with other sites in Wittenberg and Eisleben associated with Martin Luther and Philip Melanchthon.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Saints%27_Church,_Wittenberg</link></item><item><title>List of Catholic saints</title><description>This is an incomplete list of humans and angels whom the Catholic Church has canonized as saints. According to Catholic theology, all saints enjoy the beatific vision. Many of the saints listed here are found in the General Roman Calendar, while others may also be found in the Roman Martyrology; still others are particular to local places or religious institutes and their recognition does not extend to the larger worldwide church.
Candidates go through the following four steps on the way to being declared saints:

People also accepted as saints in the Eastern Orthodox Church and other churches are listed in Category:Christian saints by century and/or Category:Christian saints by nationality.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Catholic_saints</link></item><item><title>Saint Gordianus</title><description>Gordianus (died 362) was a Roman martyr who was killed during the reign of Julian the Apostate, and is commemorated on 10 May.
In his funeral inscription, Gordianus's youth is contrasted with his mature faith. Later Acts make him a pagan and a judge. He was charged with forcing Januarius to make a sacrifice to the Emperor, but instead was persuaded and then converted to Christianity with many within his household. Being accused before his successor, or as some say before the prefect of the city, Apronianus, he was tortured and finally beheaded. His body was carried off by the Christians, and laid in a crypt on the Latin Way beside the body of Epimachus of Alexandria, who had been recently interred there. The two saints gave their name to the cemetery, and have ever since been jointly venerated by the Catholic Church. According to David Farmer, these Acts are historically "worthless".
Some time later the remains of Gordianus were moved to the Cyriaca cemetery and there they lay until the 1670s, when a monk named Ambrose of the Order of St Augustin removed them and gave them to Christopher Anderson, a Jesuit priest. The remains were transferred to the Jesuit College of St. Omer; when the College moved to Stonyhurst, the remains travelled to England where they have remained since, interred below the altar of the Sodality Chapel.  His bones were temporarily removed in 2006 whilst the chapel underwent restoration, but they have since been returned.
The Princely Abbey of Kempten in Bavaria was established in 752, and dedicated to the Virgin Mary and Gordianus and Epimachus. Some of the relics of the two saints were brought there.
There is a church dedicated to Gordianus in Saint-Paul-d'Oueil in France.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Gordianus</link></item></channel></rss>
