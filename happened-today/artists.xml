The writers boycotted the event, due to be held from 28 February to 5 March 2026, after the Adelaide Festival board announced on 8 January that they had cancelled the scheduled appearance of Australian author Randa Abdel-Fattah, saying that it would "not be culturally sensitive" to do so following the 2025 Bondi Beach shooting.
By 13 January, around 180 participants had withdrawn from Writers' Week, and all members of the Adelaide Festival board except one had resigned following the backlash. Louise Adler, director of Adelaide Writers' Week, who had disagreed with the board, also announced her resignation on 13 January, saying that she could not be party to silencing writers. On the same day, the entire event was cancelled, and four members of a new board were announced, to be led by former AF chair Judy Potter. On 15 January, the Adelaide Festival issued an apology to Abdel-Fattah and invited her to speak at Adelaide Writers' Week 2027.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Writers%27_Week_boycott</link></item><item><title>77th Writers Guild of America Awards</title><description>The 77th Writers Guild of America Awards was held on February 15, 2025, to honor the best writing in film, television and radio of 2024.

Albertino Mussato of Padua and Francesco Petrarca (Petrarch) of Arezzo were the first to be crowned poets laureate after the classical age, respectively in 1315 and 1342. In Britain, the term dates from the appointment of Bernard André by Henry VII of England. The royal office of Poet Laureate in England dates from the appointment of John Dryden in 1668.
In modern times a poet laureate title may be conferred by an organization such as the Poetry Foundation, which designates a Young People's Poet Laureate, unconnected with the National Youth Poet Laureate and the United States Poet Laureate.
The office is also popular with regional and community groups. Examples include the Pikes Peak Poet Laureate, which is designated by a "Presenting Partners" group from within the community, the Minnesota poet laureate chosen by the League of Minnesota Poets (est. 1934), the Northampton Poet Laureate chosen by the Northampton Arts Council, and the Martha's Vineyard Poet Laureate chosen by ten judges representing the Martha's Vineyard Poetry Society.
