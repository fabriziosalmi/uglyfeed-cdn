It is the largest interruption to American film and television production since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as well as the largest labor stoppage for the Writers Guild of America (WGA) since the 2007–08 strike.
On July 14, 2023, SAG-AFTRA joined the WGA in its own strike, halting production on any remaining film or television series that previously had continued during the WGA strike. On September 24, 2023, the WGA suspended picketing upon reaching a tentative agreement. Following a vote, the union leadership voted to end the strike on September 27, 2023, at 12:01 a.m. PDT.
The SAG-AFTRA strike ended on November 9, 2023, at 12:01 a.m. PDT.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_productions_impacted_by_the_2023_Writers_Guild_of_America_strike</link></item><item><title>Poet laureate</title><description>A poet laureate (plural: poets laureate) is a poet officially appointed by a government or conferring institution, typically expected to compose poems for special events and occasions. Albertino Mussato of Padua and Francesco Petrarca (Petrarch) of Arezzo were the first to be crowned poets laureate after the classical age, respectively in 1315 and 1342. In Britain, the term dates from the appointment of Bernard André by Henry VII of England. The royal office of Poet Laureate in England dates from the appointment of John Dryden in 1668.
In modern times a poet laureate title may be conferred by an organization such as the Poetry Foundation, which designates a Young People's Poet Laureate, unconnected with the National Youth Poet Laureate and the United States Poet Laureate.
The office is also popular with regional and community groups. Examples include the Pikes Peak Poet Laureate, which is designated by a "Presenting Partners" group from within the community, the Minnesota poet laureate chosen by the League of Minnesota Poets (est. 1934), the Northampton Poet Laureate chosen by the Northampton Arts Council, and the Martha's Vineyard Poet Laureate chosen by ten judges representing the Martha's Vineyard Poetry Society.

It was released on April 19, 2024, by Republic Records. Swift developed the album amidst the Eras Tour in 2023, with the resultant, heightened media scrutiny on her life inspiring the record.
Two hours after the album's release, it was expanded into a double album subtitled The Anthology, containing a second volume of songs. It was written and produced by Swift, Jack Antonoff, and Aaron Dessner. Self-described as her "lifeline" album, its introspective songs depict emotional tumult, with self-awareness, mourning, anger, humor, and delusion as dominant themes. Musically, the album is a minimalist chamber pop and synth-pop effort with folk, country and rock stylings. The composition is largely mid-tempo, driven by a mix of synthesizers and drum machines with piano and guitar, whereas the visual aesthetic draws mainly from dark academia.
The album broke numerous commercial records, including the highest single-day and single-week streams for an album on Spotify. It topped the charts across Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Americas. In the United States, The Tortured Poets Department became Swift's record-extending seventh album to open with over a million units, spent a career-best 17 weeks atop the Billboard 200, and was certified six-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Its songs made Swift the only artist to monopolize the Billboard Hot 100's top 14 spots, led by "Fortnight" featuring Post Malone. It became the global best-selling album of 2024.
Critical reception to The Tortured Poets Department was polarized upon release; critics praised Swift's cathartic songwriting for its emotional resonance and wit, but some found the album lengthy and lacking profundity. Subsequent assessments have better appreciated the album's musical and lyrical nuances, while disputing initial critiques for allegedly focusing on Swift's public image rather than artistic merit. It received various accolades, including the 2025 Premios Odeón for Best International Album and an Album of the Year nomination at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards. Swift included songs from the album in a revamped Eras Tour set from May to December 2024.
