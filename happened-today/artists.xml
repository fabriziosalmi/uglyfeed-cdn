It forms part of the Adelaide Festival of Arts and comes under its governance.  Writers' Week is held outdoors in the Pioneer Women's Memorial Garden, where attendees meet, listen, and discuss literature with Australian and international writers in "Meet the Author" sessions, readings, and lectures.
Each Adelaide Writers' Week includes six days of free panel-sessions presented live in the gardens, later made available online via podcast. Selected sessions are shown live via videolink in some libraries. There are also free events for children and young adults, at which children's authors present their work for a range of ages, and other activities take place. The programme also features a series of ticketed special events, both at Adelaide Festival time and throughout the year.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Writers%27_Week</link></item><item><title>List of productions impacted by the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike</title><description>The 2023 Writers Guild of America strike had a significant impact on the film and television industries of the United States, causing many film and television projects to shut down or postpone production. It is the largest interruption to American film and television production since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as well as the largest labor stoppage for the Writers Guild of America (WGA) since the 2007–08 strike.
On July 14, 2023, SAG-AFTRA joined the WGA in its own strike, halting production on any remaining film or television series that previously had continued during the WGA strike. On September 24, 2023, the WGA suspended picketing upon reaching a tentative agreement. Following a vote, the union leadership voted to end the strike on September 27, 2023, at 12:01 a.m. PDT.
The SAG-AFTRA strike ended on November 9, 2023, at 12:01 a.m. PDT.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_productions_impacted_by_the_2023_Writers_Guild_of_America_strike</link></item><item><title>Elizabeth Alexander (poet)</title><description>Elizabeth Alexander (born May 30, 1962) is an American poet, writer, and literary scholar who has served as the president of the Andrew W.
