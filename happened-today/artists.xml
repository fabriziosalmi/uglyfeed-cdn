Albertino Mussato of Padua and Francesco Petrarca (Petrarch) of Arezzo were the first to be crowned poets laureate after the classical age, respectively in 1315 and 1342. In Britain, the term dates from the appointment of Bernard André by Henry VII of England. The royal office of Poet Laureate in England dates from the appointment of John Dryden in 1668.
In modern times a poet laureate title may be conferred by an organization such as the Poetry Foundation, which designates a Young People's Poet Laureate, unconnected with the National Youth Poet Laureate and the United States Poet Laureate.
The office is also popular with regional and community groups. Examples include the Pikes Peak Poet Laureate, which is designated by a "Presenting Partners" group from within the community, the Minnesota poet laureate chosen by the League of Minnesota Poets (est. 1934), the Northampton Poet Laureate chosen by the Northampton Arts Council, and the Martha's Vineyard Poet Laureate chosen by ten judges representing the Martha's Vineyard Poetry Society.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poet_laureate</link></item><item><title>Damon Evans (athletic director)</title><description>Damon M. Evans is the athletics director at the Southern Methodist University. Since October 2017, Evans has served as the interim athletic director at Maryland and in June 2018, was named the permanent athletic director.
After graduating from Gainesville High School in Hall County, Georgia, Evans played football for the University of Georgia (UGA), and graduated from the Terry College of Business in 1992 with a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) degree in finance. He earned his Master of Education (M.Ed.) in sports management from UGA in 1994.
Evans was an intern with the Southeastern Conference (SEC) in 1993 as a compliance and academic affairs assistant, then served as director of compliance and operations at the University of Missouri in 1994. In 1995, Evans returned to the SEC as the director of compliance and was promoted to assistant commissioner for compliance in 1997. He returned to UGA as an associate athletics director in 1998.
Evans served from 1998 to 2001 as a member of the NCAA Division I-A management council and as chair of the UGA academic task force in charge of reviewing academic credentials of prospective student-athletes. He became senior associate athletics director in 2000. In December 2003, UGA president Michael F. Adams announced that Evans would succeed long-time AD and former Bulldogs coach Vince Dooley on July 1, 2004.
As of 2006, the University of Georgia Athletic Association comprised 19 intercollegiate teams, over 500 student-athletes, a $65 million budget and a 250-person staff. For fiscal 2005, the Athletic Association had the largest operating profit among collegiate athletic programs at US$23.9 Million from a gross profit of US$68.8 Million. SportsBusiness Journal, citing Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act forms, said UGA reported $67.05 million in football revenue in 2007–2008, second only to the University of Texas ($72.95 million).
In October 2017, Evans was named interim athletic director at the University of Maryland after former athletic director, Kevin Anderson, announced he would take a six-month sabbatical leave. On June 25, 2018, Evans was named permanent athletic director by the university.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damon_Evans_(athletic_director)</link></item><item><title>Academy Award for Best Director</title><description>The Academy Award for Best Director (officially known as the Academy Award of Merit for Directing) is an award presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS). It is given in honor of a film director who has exhibited outstanding directing while working in the film industry.
The 1st Academy Awards ceremony was held in 1929 with the award being split into "Dramatic" and "Comedy" categories; Frank Borzage and Lewis Milestone won for 7th Heaven and Two Arabian Knights, respectively. However, these categories were merged for all subsequent ceremonies. Nominees are determined by single transferable vote within the directors branch of AMPAS; winners are selected by a plurality vote from the entire eligible voting members of the academy.
For the first eleven years of the Academy Awards, directors were allowed to be nominated for multiple films in the same year. However, after the nomination of Michael Curtiz for two films, Angels with Dirty Faces and Four Daughters, at the 11th Academy Awards, the rules were revised so that an individual could only be nominated for one film at each ceremony. That rule has since been amended, although the only director who has received multiple nominations in the same year was Steven Soderbergh for Erin Brockovich and Traffic in 2000, winning the award for the latter.
The Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture have been very closely linked throughout their history. Of the 91 films that won Best Picture and were also nominated for Best Director, 70 won the award. The award has been criticised in recent years for failing to recognise female directors. Of the 257 individual directors nominated in the history of the award, only 9 have been women; and only 3 of the 76 winners have been women.
Since its inception, the award has been given to 74 different directors or directing teams. As of the 97th Academy Awards ceremony, American filmmaker Sean Baker is the most recent winner in this category for his work on Anora.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Director</link></item><item><title>Tom Riley (actor)</title><description>Tom Riley (born 5 April 1981) is an English actor, producer, and director.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Riley_(actor)</link></item><item><title>Ian Chen (actor)</title><description>Ian Chen (Chinese: 陳琦燁; born September 7, 2006) is an American actor.
