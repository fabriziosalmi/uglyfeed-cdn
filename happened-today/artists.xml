It was released on April 19, 2024, through Republic Records, with a double album edition subtitled The Anthology being released two hours after the standard edition. Swift wrote and produced the album with Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner while she was embarking on the American leg of the Eras Tour in 2023.
Using autobiographical songwriting, The Tortured Poets Department reflects Swift's cathartic episode while she was experiencing personal upheavals amidst breakups and heightened fame. Its songs depict grief and emotional tumult caused by ill-fated romance in a hyperbolic and confrontational manner, exploring themes of mourning, depression, anger, delusion, erotic desires, and self-aware humor. Musically, The Tortured Poets Department features two production styles. The standard edition is largely minimalist, mid-tempo synth-pop, characterized by synthesizers, sustained bass, and programmed drums. The Anthology primarily consists of mellow, acoustic chamber pop and folk-pop ballads driven by piano and guitar. The album incorporates elements of electronica, country, rock, folk, and western.
Swift promoted the album via social media and music streaming platforms, and she included an extended set list for the Eras Tour in 2024. The Tortured Poets Department topped charts across Europe, Asia–Pacific, and the Americas; broke streaming and sales records; and became the global best-selling album of 2024. In the United States, The Tortured Poets Department became Swift's seventh album to open with over a million units and first to open with two million units, spent 17 weeks atop the Billboard 200, and was certified eight-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Its songs made Swift the first artist to monopolize the Billboard Hot 100's top 14 spots, with the lead single "Fortnight" featuring Post Malone topping the chart.
Critical reception of The Tortured Poets Department upon its release was mixed; positive reviews praised the cathartic narrative songwriting as emotionally resonant and deemed the album one of Swift's finest works, but negative reviews described the production as redundant and the lyrics verbose rather than poetic. Within weeks after the initial reviews, several journalists reassessed the album and appreciated the musical and lyrical nuances, opining that the criticism was overshadowed by Swift's media overexposure. The album received an ARIA Music Award, a Premios Odeón, a Japan Gold Disc Award, and five nominations at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year.
