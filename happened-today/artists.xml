It was released on April 19, 2024, through Republic Records, and was expanded into a double album, subtitled The Anthology, two hours after the release. Swift was inspired to develop the album by the media scrutiny on her life amidst the Eras Tour in 2023. 
Swift wrote and produced the album with Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner. Representing her cathartic episode while she was experiencing personal upheavals caused by romantic fallouts and heightened fame, its introspective songs depict emotional tumult, with self-awareness, mourning, anger, humor, and delusion as dominant themes. Musically, The Tortured Poets Department is a minimalist synth-pop, chamber pop, and dream pop effort with country and rock stylings, while The Anthology revisits a folk-pop sound reminiscent of Swift's 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore. The composition is largely mid-tempo, driven by a mix of synthesizers and drum machines with piano and guitar. The visual aesthetics were influenced by dark academia.
The album broke numerous commercial records, including the highest single-day and single-week streams for an album on Spotify. It topped the charts across Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Americas. In the United States, The Tortured Poets Department became Swift's record-extending seventh album to open with over a million units, spent a career-best 17 weeks atop the Billboard 200, and was certified eight-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Its songs made Swift the only artist to monopolize the Billboard Hot 100's top 14 spots, led by "Fortnight" featuring Post Malone. It became the world's best-selling album of 2024.
Critical reception to The Tortured Poets Department was polarized upon release; most of the reviews praised Swift's witty and emotionally resonant songwriting, but some found the album lengthy and lacking profundity. Subsequent assessments appreciated the album's musical and lyrical nuances more, while disputing initial critiques for allegedly focusing on Swift's public image rather than artistic merit. Its accolades include an ARIA Music Award, a Premios Odeón, a Japan Gold Disc Award, and five nominations at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. Swift included songs from the album in a revamped Eras Tour set from May to December 2024.

The first poet interred in Poets' Corner was Geoffrey Chaucer in 1400. William Shakespeare was commemorated with a monument in 1740, over a century after his death. Over the centuries, a tradition has grown up of interring or memorialising people there in recognition of their contribution to British culture. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the honour is awarded to writers.
