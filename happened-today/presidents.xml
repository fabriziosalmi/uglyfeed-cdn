The president is directly elected by qualified voters to a six-year term and must be "a natural-born citizen of the Philippines, a registered voter, able to read and write, at least forty years of age on the day of the election, and a resident of the Philippines for at least ten years immediately preceding such election". No elected president can seek re-election. Upon resignation, or removal from the office, the vice president assumes the post. A president's successor who hasn't served for more than four years can still seek a full term for the presidency.
The incumbent president is Bongbong Marcos, who assumed office on June 30, 2022.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_Philippines</link></item><item><title>List of presidents of India</title><description>The president of India is the head of state of the Republic of India and the supreme commander of the Indian Armed Forces. The president is referred to as the first citizen of India. Although vested with these powers by the Constitution of India, the position is largely a ceremonial one and executive powers are de facto exercised by the prime minister.
The president is elected by the Electoral College composed of elected members of the parliament houses, the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, and also members of the Saasana Sabha or Vidhan Sabha, the state legislative assemblies. Presidents may remain in office for a tenure of five years, as stated by article 56, part V, of the Constitution of India. In the case where a president's term of office is terminated early or during the absence of the president, the vice president assumes office. By article 70 of part V, the parliament may decide how to discharge the functions of the president where this is not possible, or in any other unexpected contingency.
There have been 15 presidents of India since the post was established when India was declared as a republic with the adoption of the Indian constitution in 1950. Apart from these fifteen, three acting presidents have also been in office for short periods of time. V. V. Giri became the acting president in 1969 after Zakir Husain died in office. Giri was elected president a few months later. He remains the only person to have held office both as a president and acting president. Rajendra Prasad, the first president of India, is the only person to have held office for two terms.
Seven presidents have been members of a political party before being elected. Six of these were active party members of the Indian National Congress. The Janata Party has had one member, Neelam Sanjiva Reddy, who later became president. Two presidents, Zakir Husain and Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, have died in office. Their vice presidents served as acting presidents until a new president was elected. Following Zakir Husain's death, two acting presidents held office until the new president, V. V. Giri, was elected. When Giri resigned to take part in the presidential elections, he was succeeded by Mohammad Hidayatullah as acting president. Pratibha Patil is the first woman to hold the office, elected in 2007.
On 25 July 2022, Droupadi Murmu took office as the president of India, becoming the second woman and the first tribal person to hold the office.

The first table charts the age of each vice president of the United States at the time of that person's inauguration (first inauguration if that person was elected to multiple and consecutive terms), at the time that that person left office, and at the time of that person's death. Each vice president's age at death and that person's lifespan are measured in two ways; this is to allow for the differing number of leap days occurring within each one's life. The first figure is the number of days between date of birth and date of death, allowing for leap days; in parentheses the same period given in years and days, with the years being the number of whole years that the vice president lived, and the days being the number of days after that person's last birthday. Where the vice president is still living, lifespan is calculated through June 30, 2025.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_vice_presidents_of_the_United_States_by_age</link></item><item><title>List of vice presidents of the Philippines</title><description>The vice president of the Philippines is the second-highest executive official in the government of the Philippines.

Some vice presidents have been born in one state, but are commonly associated with another. New York was the birth state of eight vice presidents, the most of any state: George Clinton, Daniel D. Tompkins, Martin Van Buren, Millard Fillmore, Schuyler Colfax, William A. Wheeler, Theodore Roosevelt, and James S. Sherman. New York was also the home state of an additional four vice presidents—Aaron Burr, Chester A. Arthur, Levi P. Morton, and Nelson Rockefeller.
While political pundits have traditionally argued that the vice-presidential candidates have little effect on election outcomes in their home state, in 2016, political scientists Boris Heersink and Brenton D. Peterson argued that vice-presidential candidates did in fact offer a home-state advantage. In an article published in American Politics Research, they presented analysis of elections spanning 1884 to 1992, which "suggest that vice-presidential candidates increase their tickets’ performance in their home states by 2.67 percentage points on average—considerably higher than previous studies have found."</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_vice_presidents_of_the_United_States_by_home_state</link></item><item><title>List of presidents of the Republic of China</title><description>This is a list of the presidents of the Republic of China.
The Republic of China controlled Mainland China before 1949.

Since 1949, the Republic of China, now commonly known as "Taiwan", has only controlled Taiwan and nearby islands. Martial law ended in Taiwan in 1987 and direct elections were introduced in 1996.
