Rocroi shattered the myth of invincibility of the Spanish Tercios, the terrifying infantry units that had dominated European battlefields for the previous 120 years. The battle is therefore often considered to mark the end of Spanish military greatness and the beginning of French hegemony in Europe during the 17th century. After Rocroi, the Spanish progressively transformed the tercio system incorporating more of the line infantry doctrine used by the French over time.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Rocroi</link></item><item><title>Battles of Narol</title><description>The Battles of Narol are a series of armed battles fought over the town of Narol, Poland, and for control of the Narol region between the Home Army supported by Peasant Battalions and the Ukrainian insurgent army during the period May to June 1944.
