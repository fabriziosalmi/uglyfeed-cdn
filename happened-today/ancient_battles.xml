Before the battle, Lord Methuen had advanced past the Riet River and towards Spytfontein after the Battle of Modder River on 28 November. With his supply line extended, the railways were subject to attack, as the bulk of the army was situated at the front, with sparse vanguards patrolling the various sidings between De Aar and Modder River. The railways were guarded by barbed wire and patrols, though before the arrival of the Australians and Canadians in 1900, the British forces were spread thin. A previous battle had occurred near Enslin on 25 November; after the major battle, a small force was detached to guard the station in-case of future attack.

Rocroi shattered the myth of invincibility of the Spanish tercios, the terrifying infantry units that had dominated European battlefields for the previous 120 years. The battle is therefore often considered to mark the end of Spanish military greatness and the beginning of French hegemony in Europe during the 17th century. After Rocroi, the Spanish progressively transformed the tercio system incorporating more of the line infantry doctrine used by the French over time.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Rocroi</link></item><item><title>List of battles 301–1300</title><description>This is a list of battles from 301 A.D. to 1300 A.D.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_battles_301%E2%80%931300</link></item><item><title>Battle of Mariupol (September 2014)</title><description>In late August and early September 2014, Russian and Russian-backed separatist troops supporting the Donetsk People's Republic advanced on the government-controlled port city of Mariupol in southern Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine.
