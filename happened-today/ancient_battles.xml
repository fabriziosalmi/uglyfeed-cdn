The Cheyenne called it the Battle Where the Girl Saved Her Brother because of an incident during the fight involving Buffalo Calf Road Woman. General George Crook's offensive was stymied by the Indians, led by Crazy Horse, and he awaited reinforcements before resuming the campaign in August.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Rosebud</link></item></channel></rss>
