Alfred's army won the battle, which resulted in the Treaty of Wedmore later that same year. Primary sources locate the battle at "Eðandun". Until a scholarly consensus linked the battle site with the present-day village of Edington in Wiltshire, it was known as the Battle of Ethandun which still continues to be used.
