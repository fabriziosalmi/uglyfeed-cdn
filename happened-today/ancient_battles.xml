The Cheyenne called it the Battle Where the Girl Saved Her Brother because of an incident during the fight involving Buffalo Calf Road Woman. General George Crook's offensive was stymied by the Indians, led by Crazy Horse, and he awaited reinforcements before resuming the campaign in August.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Rosebud</link></item><item><title>List of battles 301â€“1300</title><description>This is a List of battles from 301 A.D. to 1300 A.D.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_battles_301%E2%80%931300</link></item><item><title>Battles of Narol</title><description>The Battles of Narol are a series of armed battles fought over the town of Narol, Poland, and for control of the Narol region between the Home Army supported by Peasant Battalions and the Ukrainian insurgent army during the period May to June 1944.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Narol</link></item></channel></rss>
