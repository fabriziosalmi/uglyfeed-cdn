Before the battle, Lord Methuen had advanced past the Riet River and towards Spytfontein after the Battle of Modder River on 28 November. With his supply line extended, the railways were subject to attack, as the bulk of the army was situated at the front, with sparse vanguards patrolling the various sidings between De Aar and Modder River. The railways were guarded by barbed wire and patrols, though before the arrival of the Australians and Canadians in 1900, the British forces were spread thin. A previous battle had occurred near Enslin on 25 November; after the major battle, a small force was detached to guard the station in-case of future attack.
