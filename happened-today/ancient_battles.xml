It took place a day apart from the Battle of Sävar, on 20 August 1809. Having conquered Finland from Sweden, the Russians had a small force in the northern areas of Sweden, which the Swedes sought to eliminate through a combined assault from land and sea. The Russians moved rapidly to defend, defeating the Swedish force landed at Ratan at Sävar on 19 August. The next day, on 20 August, the Swedish riflemen was attacked and pushed out of Ratan, turning to the flotilla and starting the evacuation.
