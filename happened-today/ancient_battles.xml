The operation took place from 23 December until 29 December 1916 according to the Julian Calendar (or 5 January to 11 January according to the Gregorian Calendar). The 12th Army was commanded by Gen. Radko Dimitriev; it was opposed by the German 8th Army.
The battles took place in a swampy region, Tīreļpurvs (Tīrelis bog), between Lake Babīte and Jelgava. The main assault force was the 6th Siberian Rifle Corps which included two Latvian Riflemen brigades ("strēlnieki" who became a part of Latvian folklore and an important factor in the Latvian national awakening movement).</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Battles</link></item></channel></rss>
