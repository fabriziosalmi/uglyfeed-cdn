Rocroi shattered the myth of invincibility of the Spanish Tercios, the terrifying infantry units that had dominated European battlefields for the previous 120 years. The battle is therefore often considered to mark the end of Spanish military greatness and the beginning of French hegemony in Europe during the 17th century. After Rocroi, the Spanish progressively transformed the tercio system incorporating more of the line infantry doctrine used by the French over time.

As Sardarabad is approximately 40 kilometres (25 mi) west of the capital of Yerevan, the battle not only halted the Ottoman advance into the rest of Armenia, but also prevented the complete destruction of the Armenian nation. The battle paved the way for the establishment of the First Republic of Armenia and the Treaty of Batum: recognition of Armenia by the Ottoman Empire.
In the words of Christopher J. Walker, had the Armenians lost this battle, "it is perfectly possible that the word Armenia would have henceforth denoted only an antique geographical term".</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sardarabad</link></item><item><title>Battle of Edington</title><description>The Battle of Edington or Battle of Ethandun was a battle between an army of the kingdom of Wessex under Alfred the Great and the Great Heathen Army led by Guthrum sometime between 6 and 12 May 878. Alfred's army won the battle, which resulted in the Treaty of Wedmore later that same year.
