The league's 29 teams were divided into the Eastern and Western conferences. This was the first season since the 2016 season to have no new expansion teams joining MLS; San Diego FC joined the league in 2025.
Pre-season matches ran from January 19 through February 17. The regular season began on February 21 and ended on October 19, with a pause from late July to late August for the 2024 Leagues Cup, which comprised all MLS and Liga MX teams. The 2024 MLS Cup playoffs began on October 22 and concluded with MLS Cup 2024 on December 7. MLS only sent eight senior squads to the 2024 U.S. Open Cup as part of a compromise with the USSF that allowed most teams to be represented by MLS Next Pro teams.
The Columbus Crew were the reigning MLS Cup champions and FC Cincinnati were the Supporters' Shield holders; St. Louis City SC were the reigning Western Conference champions. In their fifth season in the league, Inter Miami CF won the Supporters' Shield for the first time, earning an league-record 74 points. The LA Galaxy won a record sixth MLS Cup, and a first since 2014, after defeating the New York Red Bulls 2–1 at Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, California.
This was the second season that Apple and MLS were part of a ten-year partnership for the broadcast and streaming rights to all MLS and Leagues Cup games, as well as select MLS Next and MLS Next Pro games, on the MLS Season Pass service within the Apple TV app.

The team is governed by the United States Soccer Federation, which is a member of FIFA since 1914 and was a founding member of CONCACAF since 1961. It was also affiliated with NAFC, which was a predecessor confederation of CONCACAF and the former governing soccer body in North America from 1946 to 1961.
The U.S. has appeared in eleven FIFA World Cups, including the first in 1930, where they reached the semifinals; their third-place finish, which was later awarded through overall tournament records, is the best result by a team from outside UEFA and CONMEBOL. They returned in 1934 and 1950, defeating England 1–0 in the latter, but did not qualify again until 1990. As host in 1994, the U.S. received an automatic berth and lost to Brazil in the round of 16. They qualified for the next five World Cups, a feat shared with only seven other nations. The U.S. reached the quarter-finals at the 2002 World Cup.
The United States are the second most successful national team in its confederation, winning 10 CONCACAF continental titles (seven CONCACAF Gold Cups and three CONCACAF Nations League titles). The United States finished fourth place in two Copa América editions (1995 and 2016). Globally, the United States finished runners-up in the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup, beating top-ranked European champions Spain in the semi-final and losing to Brazil in the final.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men%27s_national_soccer_team</link></item><item><title>2025 Canadian Soccer League season</title><description>The 2025 Major League Soccer season is the ongoing 30th season of Major League Soccer (MLS), the top professional soccer league in the United States and Canada, and the 47th season overall of a national first-division league in the United States.
MLS expanded to 30 clubs this season with the addition of San Diego FC, an expansion team awarded in 2023. The league's 30 teams are divided into the Eastern and Western conferences, which each have 15 teams. The regular season runs from February 22 to October 18 and comprises 34 matches for each team with a schedule that is primarily intra-conference with 6 inter-conference matches per team. There was a break for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup and 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup in late June but no break for the 2025 Leagues Cup in August. The San Jose Earthquakes hosted D.C. United on April 6, 2025, in a nod to the inaugural MLS match played by the same two teams, as part of recognition of the league's 30th anniversary.
All MLS games will be broadcast on MLS Season Pass for the third year as part of a ten-year partnership between MLS and Apple Inc. for the broadcast and streaming rights to all MLS and Leagues Cup games, as well as select MLS Next and MLS Next Pro games.
The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, hosted by the United States, took place during the middle of the season and included MLS participants Seattle Sounders FC, Inter Miami CF, and Los Angeles FC. The 2025 edition of the Leagues Cup took place between July 29 and August 31.
The LA Galaxy are the reigning MLS Cup champions and Inter Miami CF are the Supporters' Shield holders, who set the all-time points record during the 2024 season.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Major_League_Soccer_season</link></item><item><title>2025 Women's Euro Beach Soccer League</title><description>The 2025 Women's Euro Beach Soccer League was the fifth edition of the Women's Euro Beach Soccer League (WEBSL). It is the annual, premier competition in European beach soccer contested between women's national teams, succeeding the Women's Euro Beach Soccer Cup (2016–19). Organised by Beach Soccer Worldwide (BSWW), it is the women's version of the men's long-running Euro Beach Soccer League, which began in 1998.
The league consisted of two phases: two rounds of fixtures comprising the regular season, and the playoff event, the Superfinal, in which the teams then directly contest the league title, with the winners becoming WEBSL champions.
Poland were the time defending champions, but failed to defend their title, finishing in fourth place. The title was won by Portugal who won the competition for the first time.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Women%27s_Euro_Beach_Soccer_League</link></item><item><title>United States Virgin Islands national soccer team</title><description>The United States Virgin Islands national soccer team (officially recognized as US Virgin Islands by FIFA), nicknamed The Dashing Eagles, is the national soccer team of the United States Virgin Islands and is controlled by the U.S. Virgin Islands Soccer Federation.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Virgin_Islands_national_soccer_team</link></item></channel></rss>
