The league's 29 teams are divided into the Eastern and Western conferences. This is the first season since the 2016 season to have no new expansion teams joining MLS; San Diego FC is scheduled to join the league in 2025. Inter Miami CF won the 2024 Supporters' Shield; the Columbus Crew are the reigning MLS Cup champions.
Pre-season matches ran from January 19 through February 17. The regular season began on February 21 and ended on October 19, with a pause from late July to late August for the 2024 Leagues Cup, which comprised all MLS and Liga MX teams. The 2024 MLS Cup playoffs began on October 22 and are scheduled to conclude with MLS Cup 2024 on December 7. MLS only sent 8 senior squads to the 2024 U.S. Open Cup as part of a compromise with the USSF that allowed most teams to be represented by MLS Next Pro teams.
This is the second season that Apple and MLS are part of a ten-year partnership for the broadcast and streaming rights to all MLS and Leagues Cup games, as well as select MLS Next and MLS Next Pro games, on the MLS Season Pass service within the Apple TV app.
The United States will be the host country for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup. MLS clubs could qualify as a host nation club, with Inter Miami CF qualifying as the 2024 MLS Supporters' Shield champions. MLS clubs were also able to qualify through the 2021–2024 editions of the CONCACAF Champions Cup/CONCACAF Champions League. Seattle Sounders FC have qualified as the 2022 CONCACAF Champions League winners.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Major_League_Soccer_season</link></item><item><title>List of El Clásico matches</title><description>This is a list of all matches contested between the Spanish football clubs Barcelona and Real Madrid, a fixture known as El Clásico.

The team is a member of the Big Ten Conference of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The Nittany Lions play at Jeffrey Field in State College, Pennsylvania on the campus of Pennsylvania State University.
The formation of a women's soccer program at Pennsylvania State University began with the creation of Penn State Women's Club Soccer in 1977 by the International Soccer Club at Pennsylvania State University. The team's creation was a response to women being excluded from playing on intramural soccer teams at the university. The club would go on to compete in international tours and gain national recognition all while competing without the support of the university. The club began petitioning Penn State Athletics for varsity status in 1980 citing a need for funding and status to continue its operation. After being denied varsity status by the university in 1980 and 1981 Penn State Women's Club Soccer filed a Title IX gender discrimination complaint with the Office of Civil Rights. The team would eventually join the Big Ten Conference and National Collegiate Athletic Association in 1994 when Penn State adopted a varsity women's soccer program under Big Ten direction.
The Nittany Lions have won 30 trophies: 1 NCAA Tournament championship, 9 Big Ten Tournament championships, 20 Big Ten regular season championships. The team has fielded two Hermann Trophy winners: Christie Welsh (2001) and Raquel Rodríguez (2015). The Nittany Lions notable alumnae include United States women's national soccer team players Alyssa Naeher, Ali Krieger and Allie Long who are FIFA Women's World Cup champions.

As of 2024, there are 14 teams across the United States.
Through the 2023 season, six teams (one now defunct) have been crowned NWSL Champions, awarded to the playoff winner, and five teams (one defunct) have claimed the NWSL Shield, awarded to the team in first place at the end of the regular season.
