The league's 29 teams were divided into the Eastern and Western conferences. This was the first season since the 2016 season to have no new expansion teams joining MLS; San Diego FC joined the league in 2025.
Pre-season matches ran from January 19 through February 17. The regular season began on February 21 and ended on October 19, with a pause from late July to late August for the 2024 Leagues Cup, which comprised all MLS and Liga MX teams. The 2024 MLS Cup playoffs began on October 22 and concluded with MLS Cup 2024 on December 7. MLS only sent eight senior squads to the 2024 U.S. Open Cup as part of a compromise with the USSF that allowed most teams to be represented by MLS Next Pro teams.
The Columbus Crew were the reigning MLS Cup champions and FC Cincinnati were the Supporters' Shield holders; St. Louis City SC were the reigning Western Conference champions. In their fifth season in the league, Inter Miami CF won the Supporters' Shield for the first time, earning an league-record 74 points. The LA Galaxy won a record sixth MLS Cup, and a first since 2014, after defeating the New York Red Bulls 2–1 at Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, California.
This was the second season that Apple and MLS were part of a ten-year partnership for the broadcast and streaming rights to all MLS and Leagues Cup games, as well as select MLS Next and MLS Next Pro games, on the MLS Season Pass service within the Apple TV app.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Major_League_Soccer_season</link></item><item><title>2022 Kirin Cup Soccer</title><description>The 2022 Kirin Cup Soccer (Japanese: キリンカップサッカー2022) was the 33rd edition of the international friendly football tournament Kirin Cup Soccer organised by the Japan Football Association, which was played in Japan between 10 and 14 June 2022, with the participation of four teams: Japan, Chile, Ghana and Tunisia.

The team is governed by the United States Soccer Federation, which is a member of FIFA since 1914 and was a founding member of CONCACAF since 1961. It was also affiliated with NAFC, which was a predecessor confederation of CONCACAF and the former governing soccer body in North America from 1946 to 1961.
The U.S. has appeared in eleven FIFA World Cups, including the first in 1930, where they reached the semifinals; their third-place finish, which was later awarded through overall tournament records, is the best result by a team from outside UEFA and CONMEBOL. They returned in 1934 and 1950, defeating England 1–0 in the latter, but did not qualify again until 1990. As host in 1994, the U.S. received an automatic berth and lost to Brazil in the round of 16. They qualified for the next five World Cups, a feat shared with only seven other nations. The U.S. reached the quarter-finals at the 2002 World Cup. The U.S. will host 2026 alongside Mexico and Canada.
The United States are the second most successful national team in its confederation, winning 10 CONCACAF continental titles (seven CONCACAF Gold Cups and three CONCACAF Nations League titles). The United States finished fourth place in two Copa América editions (1995 and 2016). Globally, the United States finished runners-up in the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup, beating top-ranked European champions Spain in the semi-final and losing to Brazil in the final.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men%27s_national_soccer_team</link></item><item><title>Soccer in Geelong</title><description>Soccer in Geelong, Australia dates as far back as the late 1800s where mostly British migrants during the early colonization of the Victorian gold rush participated in a variety of ball games similar to British Association rules (soccer) and rugby. British migrants employed at the emerging industries took part in formal games in Geelong from at least 1914 when the Geelong City club was formed.
After World War I interrupted the establishment of the game in the region, a huge influx of the British migrants and the burgeoning industrial sector in Geelong aided the creation of the Geelong and District Soccer League in 1926. The 1930s saw the economic depression curtail recreational sport as jobs and employment take precedent. Following World War II, the arrival of European migrants, mainly from Britain and the Netherlands, helped to transform football in the Geelong region. The emergence of new multicultural football clubs helped to drive the game through from the 1970s to the 1990s.
In the early 2000s, strong population growth, growing football participation, and the mainstream acceptance of the game established a new dynamic of football in the region. Four new clubs emerged in the Bellarine Peninsula region of Geelong from 2000 to 2009.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soccer_in_Geelong</link></item></channel></rss>
