The five-match tournament took place at campus sites for the quarterfinals and First Horizon Stadium in Cary, North Carolina for the semifinals and final. The higher seed hosted the campus site matches. The six-team single-elimination tournament consisted of three rounds based on seeding from regular season conference play. The Florida State Seminoles were the five-time defending champions. The Seminoles were unable to defend their title, as they lost in a penalty shoot-out in the First Round. The final was contested by the first seed Stanford and second seed Notre Dame, who were also the first and second ranked teams in the United Soccer Coaches Poll at the time of the match. The teams played to a 2–2 draw, and Stanford prevailed 5–4 in the ensuing penalty shoot-out. This was Stanford's first ACC tournament title, after they joined the conference last year. It was also the first title for head coach Paul Ratcliffe. As tournament champions, Stanford earned the ACC's automatic berth into the 2025 NCAA Division I women's soccer tournament.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_ACC_women%27s_soccer_tournament</link></item><item><title>2024 Major League Soccer season</title><description>The 2024 Major League Soccer season was the 29th season of Major League Soccer (MLS), the top professional soccer league in the United States and Canada, and the 46th season overall of a national first-division league in the United States.
The league's 29 teams were divided into the Eastern and Western conferences. This was the first season since the 2016 season to have no new expansion teams joining MLS; San Diego FC joined the league in 2025.
Pre-season matches ran from January 19 through February 17. The regular season began on February 21 and ended on October 19, with a pause from late July to late August for the 2024 Leagues Cup, which comprised all MLS and Liga MX teams. The 2024 MLS Cup playoffs began on October 22 and concluded with MLS Cup 2024 on December 7. MLS only sent eight senior squads to the 2024 U.S. Open Cup as part of a compromise with the USSF that allowed most teams to be represented by MLS Next Pro teams.
The Columbus Crew were the reigning MLS Cup champions and FC Cincinnati were the Supporters' Shield holders; St. Louis City SC were the reigning Western Conference champions. In their fifth season in the league, Inter Miami CF won the Supporters' Shield for the first time, earning an league-record 74 points. The LA Galaxy won a record sixth MLS Cup, and a first since 2014, after defeating the New York Red Bulls 2–1 at Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, California.
This was the second season that Apple and MLS were part of a ten-year partnership for the broadcast and streaming rights to all MLS and Leagues Cup games, as well as select MLS Next and MLS Next Pro games, on the MLS Season Pass service within the Apple TV app.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Major_League_Soccer_season</link></item><item><title>Patrick Agyemang (soccer, born 2000)</title><description>Patrick K.
