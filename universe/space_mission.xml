It embarked on its first mission, STS-49, in May 1992 and its 25th and final mission, STS-134, in May 2011. STS-134 was expected to be the final mission of the Space Shuttle program, but with the authorization of STS-135 by the United States Congress, Atlantis became the last shuttle to fly.
The United States Congress approved the construction of Endeavour in 1987 to replace the Space Shuttle Challenger, which was destroyed in 1986.
NASA chose, on cost grounds, to build much of Endeavour from spare parts rather than refitting the Space Shuttle Enterprise, and used structural spares built during the construction of Discovery and Atlantis in its assembly.
The building housing the space shuttle in the upcoming Samuel Oschin Air and Space Center at the California Science Center was nearing completion in 2025 with extensive artifact and exhibit installations to follow.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Endeavour</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 05:02:01 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
