Some rovers have been designed as land vehicles to transport members of a human spaceflight crew; others have been partially or fully autonomous robots.  Rovers are typically created to land on another planet (other than Earth) via a lander-style spacecraft, tasked to collect information about the terrain, and to take crust samples such as dust, soil, rocks, and even liquids. They are essential tools in space exploration.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rover_(space_exploration)</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Oct 2024 05:02:03 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
