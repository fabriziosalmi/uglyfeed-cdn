It is part of the ground segment of spacecraft operations. A staff of flight controllers and other support personnel monitor all aspects of the mission using telemetry, and send commands to the vehicle using ground stations. Personnel supporting the mission from an MCC can include representatives of the attitude control system, power, propulsion, thermal, attitude dynamics, orbital operations and other subsystem disciplines. The training for these missions usually falls under the responsibility of the flight controllers, typically including extensive rehearsals in the MCC.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_control_center</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2025 05:01:47 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
