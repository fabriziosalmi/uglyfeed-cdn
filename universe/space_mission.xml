The Asteroid Retrieval Robotic Mission (ARRM) spacecraft would have rendezvoused with a large near-Earth asteroid and used robotic arms with anchoring grippers to retrieve a 4-meter boulder from the asteroid.
The spacecraft would have characterized the asteroid and demonstrated at least one planetary defense technique before transporting the boulder to a stable lunar orbit, where it could have been further analyzed both by robotic probes and by a future crewed mission, Asteroid Redirect Crewed Mission (ARCM).  If funded, the mission would have launched in December 2021, with the additional objectives to test a number of new capabilities needed for future human expeditions to deep space, including advanced ion thrusters.
The proposed 2018 NASA budget called for its cancellation, the mission was given its notice of defunding in April 2017, and NASA announced the "close out" on June 13, 2017. Key technologies being developed for ARM have continued, especially the ion thruster propulsion system that would have been flown on the robotic mission.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_Redirect_Mission</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 05:28:18 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
