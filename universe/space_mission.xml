The NASAâ€“ESA plan, approved in September 2022, is to return samples using three missions: a sample collection mission (Perseverance), a sample retrieval mission (Sample Retrieval Lander + Mars Ascent Vehicle + Sample Transfer Arm + 2 Ingenuity-class helicopters), and a return mission (Earth Return Orbiter). The mission hopes to resolve the question of whether Mars once harbored life.
Although the proposal is still in the design stage, the Perseverance rover is currently gathering samples on Mars and the components of the sample retrieval lander are in the testing phase on Earth.
After a project review critical of its cost and complexity, NASA announced that the project was "paused" as of November 13, 2023. On November 22, NASA was reported to have cut back on the Mars sample-return mission due to a possible shortage of funds. In April 2024, in a NASA update via teleconference, the NASA Administrator emphasized continuing the commitment to retrieving the samples. However, under the then-current mission profile, the cost of $11 billion was infeasible. Therefore, NASA turned to industry and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to form a new, more fiscally feasible mission profile to retrieve the samples. As of 2025, it is uncertain if NASA will move forward with MSR.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA-ESA_Mars_Sample_Return</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 05:01:56 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
