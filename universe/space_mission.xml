The main goal of the mission is to detect, quantify, and characterize the impacts of near-Earth meteoroids on the lunar far side. The spacecraft consists of a 12-U CubeSat that will operate in a halo orbit around the L2 Lagrange point of the Earth-Moon system. It is an autonomus mission of the European Space Agency and is currently being developed by an international consortium which includes Politecnico di Milano, Argotec, Leonardo, IMT, Nautilus and S&amp;T Norway.
The main scientific payload of LUMIO is a custom-designed optical camera, called LUMIO-Cam, which will observe the lunar surface in umbra to detect the flashes caused by asteroid impacts. Scientific data from the mission will be integrated with observations from the Earth to elaborate the first complete and accurate model of meteoroids flux in the lunar environment.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LUMIO_(space_mission)</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2025 05:02:03 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
