After the landing by Apollo 12, Apollo 20, which would have been the final crewed mission to the Moon, was canceled to allow Skylab to launch as a "dry workshop" (assembled on the ground in an unused S-IVB Saturn IB second stage). The next two missions, Apollos 18 and 19, were later canceled after the aforementioned Apollo 13 incident and further budget cuts. Two Skylab missions also ended up being canceled. Two complete Saturn V rockets remained unused and were put on display in the United States.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canceled_Apollo_missions</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 05:02:05 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
