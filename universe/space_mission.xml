It began in 2003 with the launch of the two rovers to explore the Martian surface and geology; both landed on Mars at separate locations in January 2004.  Both rovers far outlived their planned missions of 90 Martian solar days: MER-A Spirit was active until March 22, 2010, while MER-B Opportunity was active until June 10, 2018.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Exploration_Rover</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2025 05:02:09 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
