Three uncrewed flights, named Gaganyaan-1, Gaganyaan-2 and Gaganyaan-3 are scheduled to launch in 2025, followed by crewed flight in 2026 on an HLVM3 rocket.
Before the Gaganyaan mission announcement in August 2018, human spaceflight was not a priority for ISRO, but it had been working on related technologies since 2007, and it performed a Crew Module Atmospheric Re-entry Experiment and a Pad Abort Test for the mission. In December 2018, the Indian government approved a further ₹100 billion crore (US$1.5 billion) for a 7-day crewed flight of 2–3 astronauts.
If completed successfully, India will become the fourth nation to conduct independent human spaceflight after the Soviet Union, United States, and China. After conducting the first crewed spaceflights, the agency intends to start a space station programme, crewed lunar landings, and crewed interplanetary missions in the long term.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Human_Spaceflight_Programme</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 05:01:59 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
