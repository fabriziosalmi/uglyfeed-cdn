The corresponding feminine forms in Syriac are Morth and Marth for "lady" (Syriac: ܡܪܬܝ, Mārt(y)). 
It is a title of reverence in Syriac Christianity, where the title is placed before the Christian name, as in Mar Aprem / Mor Afrem for Ephrem the Syrian, and Marth / Morth Maryam for St Mary. It is given to all saints and is also used in instead of "Most Reverend", just before the name in religion taken by bishops. The title of Moran Mor / Maran Mar is given to the Catholicoi and other primates; and the title Mar / Mor is given to prelates such as metropolitan bishops or archbishops.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar_(title)</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2024 05:01:47 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
