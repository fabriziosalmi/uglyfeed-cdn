The flight is scheduled to lift off from Launch Complex 39A at the Kennedy Space Center no earlier than June 8, 2025 at 13:00 UTC (9:00 am EDT, local time at the launch site) and will last about two to three weeks. It will use a SpaceX Falcon 9 Block 5 rocket to place Crew Dragon C213 into low Earth orbit. This will be the maiden flight of the C213 spacecraft, the fifth—and potentially final—Crew Dragon to be built.
The crew of four consists of commander Peggy Whitson, an Axiom employee; pilot Shubhanshu Shukla of the Indian Space Research Organisation; and mission specialists Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski, a European Space Agency project astronaut from Poland, and Tibor Kapu representing the Hungarian Space Office.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_Mission_4</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 05:01:52 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
