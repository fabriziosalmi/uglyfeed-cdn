Near-term physical exploration missions, focused on obtaining new information about the Solar System, are planned and announced by both national and private organisations.
Tentative plans for crewed orbital and landing missions to the Moon and Mars to establish scientific outposts will later enable permanent and self-sufficient settlements. Further exploration will potentially involve expedition and the other planets and settlements on the Moon, as well as establishing mining and fueling outposts, particularly in the asteroid belt. Physical exploration outside the Solar System will be robotic for the foreseeable future.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_of_space_exploration</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Dec 2024 05:01:44 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
