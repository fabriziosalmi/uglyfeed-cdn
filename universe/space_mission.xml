The rover is named after Rosalind Franklin, a British chemist and DNA research pioneer. Rosalind Franklin will be the first Mars rover to drill into a depth of up to two metres below the planet's surface. The rover was designed to search for biomolecules or biosignatures from past life. Its core task is to determine whether life ever existed on Mars, or still does today. As of 2025, Rosalind Franklin is expected to launch in 2028. The rover, together with the Airbus-built Landing Platform, will travel to Mars inside the Descent Module, connected to the Carrier Module.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalind_Franklin_(rover)</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:29:49 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
