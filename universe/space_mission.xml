Such a mission would allow more extensive analysis than that allowed by onboard sensors. 
Risks of cross-contamination of the Earth biosphere from returned Martian samples have been raised, though the risk of this occurring is considered to be low.
Some of the most recent concepts are a NASA-ESA proposal; a CNSA proposal, Tianwen-3 and a Roscosmos proposal, Mars-Grunt. In addition, a JAXA proposal, Martian Moons eXploration (MMX,) is aimed at returning samples from Phobos. Although NASA and ESA's plans to return the samples to Earth are still in the design stage as of 2024, samples have been gathered on Mars by the Perseverance rover.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_sample-return_mission</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 05:15:12 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
