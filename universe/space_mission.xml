Some rovers have been designed as land vehicles to transport members of a human spaceflight crew; others have been partially or fully autonomous robots.
Rovers typically land on a planet other than Earth or a moon via a lander-style spacecraft, tasked to move around and collect information about the terrain, and to take crust samples such as dust, soil, rocks and even liquids. They are essential astrogeology tools for space exploration.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rover_(space_exploration)</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:07:04 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
