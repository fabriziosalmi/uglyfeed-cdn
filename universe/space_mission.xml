The attraction simulates what an astronaut might experience aboard a spacecraft on a mission to Mars, from the higher g-force of liftoff, to the speculative hypersleep. The pavilion also includes the Mission Space: Cargo Bay gift shop, the Advanced Training Lab interactive play area and Space 220 Restaurant.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission:_Space</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Aug 2024 05:01:54 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
