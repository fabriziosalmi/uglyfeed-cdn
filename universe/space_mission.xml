The rover is named after Rosalind Franklin, a British chemist and DNA research pioneer.
The mission was scheduled to launch in July 2020 in cooperation with the Russian Roscosmos, and was later postponed to 2022. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has caused a delay of the programme, as the member states of the ESA voted to suspend the joint mission with Russia. in July 2022, ESA terminated its cooperation on the project with Russia. As of May 2022, the launch of the rover was not expected to occur before 2028 due to the need for a new non-Russian landing platform. In 2024, the mission received additional funding to restart and complete the mission. The award went to Thales Alenia Space and launch was scheduled for 2028. ESA also signed an agreement with NASA to procure a US launch vehicle for the mission.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalind_Franklin_(rover)</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jul 2025 05:03:40 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
