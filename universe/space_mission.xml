Of multiple attempted Mars landings by robotic, uncrewed spacecraft, ten have had successful soft landings. There have also been studies for a possible human mission to Mars including a landing, but none has been attempted.
As of 2023, the Soviet Union, United States, and China have conducted Mars landings successfully. Soviet Mars 3, which landed in 1971, was the first successful Mars landing, though the spacecraft failed after 110 seconds on the surface. All other Soviet Mars landing attempts failed. Viking 1 and Viking 2 were first successful NASA landers, launched in 1975. NASA's Mars Pathfinder, launched in 1996, successfully delivered the first Mars rover, Sojourner. In 2021, first Chinese lander and rover, Tianwen 1, successfully landed on Mars. The British Beagle 2 landed in 2003, but because of loss of contact and mission failure its landing would only be confirmed in 2015.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_landing</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:09:32 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
