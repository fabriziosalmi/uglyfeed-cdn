Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa stated in May 2021 that Nintendo was interested in producing more animated films based on its properties if the then-untitled Mario film was successful. Illumination CEO and producer Chris Meledandri was asked about the possibility of a sequel to The Super Mario Bros. Movie before the film's release in April 2023. Following its box office success, a new animated Mario film was announced to be in development at Illumination in March 2024, with Horvath and Jelenic returning as directors and Fogel as screenwriter.
The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is scheduled to be theatrically released in the United States on April 3, 2026.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Super_Mario_Galaxy_Movie</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 05:02:03 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
