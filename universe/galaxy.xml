It stars Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, Tony Shalhoub, Sam Rockwell, Daryl Mitchell, and Justin Long.  A parody and homage to science-fiction films and series, especially Star Trek and its fandom, the film depicts the cast of a fictional cult television series, Galaxy Quest, who are drawn into a real interstellar conflict by aliens who think the series is a documentary.
Galaxy Quest was a box office success and received positive reviews. It won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and the Nebula Award for Best Script, and was nominated for ten Saturn Awards, including Best Science Fiction Film and Best Director, Best Actress for Weaver, and Best Supporting Actor for Rickman; Allen won Best Actor.
Galaxy Quest achieved cult status, especially from Star Trek fans for its affectionate parody. Several Star Trek cast and crew members praised the film. It was included in Reader's Digest's list of the Top 100+ Funniest Movies of All Time in 2012, and Star Trek fans voted it the seventh-best Star Trek film in 2013.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_Quest</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 05:02:16 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
