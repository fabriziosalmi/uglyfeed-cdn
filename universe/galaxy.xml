The stars involved are sufficiently far apart that it is improbable that any of them will individually collide, though some stars will be ejected.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda%E2%80%93Milky_Way_collision</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2024 05:01:54 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
