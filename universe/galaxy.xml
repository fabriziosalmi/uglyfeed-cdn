The stars involved are sufficiently spaced that it is improbable that any of them would individually collide, though some stars may be ejected.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda%E2%80%93Milky_Way_collision</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 05:13:18 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
