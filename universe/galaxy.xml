The painting depicts Hera (Juno), spilling her breast milk, the infant Heracles (Hercules) and Zeus (Jupiter) in the background, identifiable by his eagle and lightning bolts. Hera's face is modelled on Rubens' wife, Hélène Fourment. The carriage is pulled by peacocks, a bird which the ancient Greeks and Romans considered sacred to both themselves and to Hera/Juno, as a result of their ability to signal changes in weather through cries and hence their perceived connection to the gods.
With a width of 244 cm (96 in) and height of 181 cm (71 in), the image was a part of the commission from Philip IV of Spain to decorate Torre de la Parada. It is now held at the Museo del Prado, in Madrid.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birth_of_the_Milky_Way</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2025 05:01:46 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
