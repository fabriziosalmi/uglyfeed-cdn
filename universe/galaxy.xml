The first model was the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2010 with 7-inch display, which was presented to the public on 2 September 2010 at the IFA in Berlin and was available on 5 November 2010. Since then, several models have been released, including models with varying display sizes. There would also be multiple connectivity options being sold, Wi-Fi only versions and Wi-Fi + Cellular options (either LTE or 5G).
In 2014, the Galaxy Tab series was later split into four separate lines:

the Galaxy Tab S series for high-end tablets,
the Galaxy Tab Active series for mid-range rugged tablets,
the Galaxy Tab A series of mid-range tablets (from 2015),
the Galaxy Tab E series for entry-level tablets.
Further changes saw the A series repositioned to entry-level (after the discontinuation of the Tab E lineup) and the S series extending to mid-range (with the introduction of the FE and Lite models).

As of 2025, the current lineup include the Galaxy Tab S (at mid-range to flagship level), the Galaxy Tab A (at entry level), and the Galaxy Tab Active (a mid-range rugged model). The Galaxy Tab S and Tab Active support the S Pen since Galaxy Tab S3.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_Tab</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 05:08:03 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
