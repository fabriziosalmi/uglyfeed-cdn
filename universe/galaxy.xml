The first models in the series were the first-generation Galaxy A3 and Galaxy A5, announced on October 31, 2014, and released in December 2014.
Following the announcement of the 2017 series, Samsung announced that they hoped to sell up to 20 million Galaxy A series smartphones, targeting consumers in Europe, Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America.
As of 2025, most of the Galaxy A series models are available in most countries. Galaxy Tab A is also part of the A series and is available in most countries as well.
In the Galaxy A series, only the Galaxy A90 5G supports Samsung DeX.
