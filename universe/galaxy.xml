The club competes in Major League Soccer (MLS) as a member of the Western Conference. The Galaxy began play in 1996 as one of the league's ten charter members.
The Galaxy were founded in 1994 and are owned by Anschutz Entertainment Group (also owners of the Los Angeles Kings, as well as an interest in the Los Angeles Lakers). In their early years, the club played home games at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. Since 2003, they have played at Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, California. The team holds a rivalry with the San Jose Earthquakes in the California Clásico and used to play the SuperClasico against city rivals Chivas USA before that team folded in 2014. Following the league's dissolution of Chivas USA, a new expansion team, Los Angeles FC (LAFC), was formed in 2014 and began play in 2018; the new L.A. rivalry was dubbed "El Tráfico".
The franchise is one of Major League Soccer's most successful teams, with a record six MLS Cups and four additional appearances in the final, and won the Western Conference regular-season title eight times, four Supporters' Shields, two U.S. Open Cups, and one CONCACAF Champions' Cup title. In 2017, the club added the dubious MLS Wooden Spoon to its trophy case for finishing at the bottom of the MLS table.
In 2007, the club made international headlines with the signing of English player David Beckham from Real Madrid, the most high-profile transaction with Major League Soccer to that point. The club has fielded other high-profile international players including Zlatan Ibrahimović, Steven Gerrard, Nigel de Jong, Robbie Keane, Ashley Cole, Marco Reus, Luis Hernández, Giovani dos Santos, Mauricio Cienfuegos, Carlos Ruiz, Jonathan dos Santos, Jorge Campos, Javier Hernández, and American Landon Donovan, who is the all-time leading scorer for the club. In 2019, Forbes estimated the club is the second most valuable in the league, worth about $480 million.
In 2024, the LA Galaxy won a record-extending sixth MLS Cup, and broke the record for most goals during a playoff campaign with 18 goals.
