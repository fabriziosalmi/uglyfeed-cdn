It is the highest point on a possible sledging route between Jupiter Glacier and Uranus Glacier. The col was first mapped from air photos taken by the Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition in 1947â€“48, by D. Searle of the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey in 1960. It was named after the Milky Way by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee from association with the nearby Planet Heights and the glaciers which are named for the planets of the Solar System.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way_(Antarctica)</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 05:01:55 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
