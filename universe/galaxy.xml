The club competes in Major League Soccer (MLS) as a member of the Western Conference. The Galaxy began play in 1996 as one of the league's ten charter members. The franchise is the league's most successful team.
The Galaxy were founded in 1994 and are owned by Anschutz Entertainment Group (also owners of the Los Angeles Kings, as well as an interest in the Los Angeles Lakers). In their early years, the club played home games at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. Since 2003, they have played at Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, California. The team holds a rivalry with the San Jose Earthquakes in the California Clásico and used to play the SuperClasico against city rivals Chivas USA before that team folded in 2014. Following the league's dissolution of Chivas USA, a new expansion team, Los Angeles FC (LAFC), was formed in 2014 and began play in 2018; the new L.A. rivalry was dubbed "El Tráfico".
The Galaxy has won a record six MLS Cups and four additional appearances in the final, and won the Western Conference regular-season title eight times, join-record four Supporters' Shields, two U.S. Open Cups, and one CONCACAF Champions' Cup title. In 2024, the Galaxy won a record-extending sixth MLS Cup, and broke the record for most goals during a playoff campaign with 18 goals.
In 2007, the club made international headlines with the signing of English player David Beckham from Real Madrid, the most high-profile transaction with MLS to that point. The club has fielded other high-profile international players including Robbie Keane, Zlatan Ibrahimović, Marco Reus, Luis Hernández, and American Landon Donovan, who is the all-time leading scorer for the club. In 2019, Forbes estimated the club is the second most valuable in the league, worth about $480 million.
