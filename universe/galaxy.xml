Based on the eponymous novel by Zhang Henshui, it stars Violet Wong as a country girl who, after being discovered by the Milky Way Film Company, rises to stardom through a Cantonese opera. She begins a romance with her co-star, portrayed by Jin Yan, who pushes her aside after being reminded of his filial obligations.
The first sound film produced by UPS, Two Stars in the Milky Way featured extensive scenes of music and dance, with dialogue presented through intertitles and songs recorded to a separate medium. The screenplay, adapted by Zhu Shilin, featured several departures from the novel in its setting and plot. It also featured elements of metafilm, presenting a self-reflexive take on the filmmaking process as well as cameos by UPS' crew and talent. After six months of production and an extensive advertising campaign, the film premiered on 13 December 1931. It is one of few surviving works of early Chinese cinema, though its soundtrack has been lost.
