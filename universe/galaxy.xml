The painting is considered one of Tintoretto’s most successful paintings in the Venetian style. It is an oil painting on canvas, and dates from ca. 1575–1580. 
It is unknown why the bottom third of the painting was cut off, but we do know that it was cut around 1727. The painting holds many symbolic references to the gods and goddesses depicted and the story itself. The painting is further known for its vivid colors that are layered and textured and for keep eyes on the complex details of the pieces.
The myth depicted in the painting is of a Roman mythological story about how the Milky Way was formed. Every part of the painting is meant to further explain the myth by putting imagery that relates to each god/goddess in the myth, i.e. Juno and Jupiter. Other elements further tell the story, such as the putti and the objects they are holding. The painting is an example of the Mannerist style that gained popularity in the late Renaissance. The dynamic, elegant poses and the repeating curves seen throughout the painting are characteristic of the Mannerist style.
Throughout the years, the painting has sustained a variety of damages, some due to age and others due to poor care. Although the painting has been documented to be in the possession of the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II, there have been some examinations of the painting that lead art historians to think that the painting had a patron before Rudolf II.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origin_of_the_Milky_Way</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2025 05:01:43 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
