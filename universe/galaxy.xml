The stars involved are sufficiently far apart that it is improbable that any of them will individually collide, though some stars will be ejected.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda%E2%80%93Milky_Way_collision</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 05:01:42 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
