Created by Frank Mars, it was his first chocolate bar product. There are two varieties of Milky Way: the original American bar made of nougat and caramel, which has been marketed as the Mars bar outside the United States; and the global Milky Way bar which has no caramel, and is marketed as 3 Musketeers in the U.S. and Canada.
