According to myth, the infant Heracles was brought to Hera by his half-sister Athena, who later played an important role as a goddess of protection. Hera nursed Heracles out of pity, but he suckled so strongly that he caused Hera pain, and she pushed him away. Her milk sprayed across the heavens and there formed the Milky Way. With divine milk, Heracles acquired supernatural powers.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origin_of_the_Milky_Way</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Oct 2024 05:01:41 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
