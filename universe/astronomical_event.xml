It premiered on Hunan TV on August 8, 2009.
Due to the success and popularity of Japanese manga Hana Yori Dango and its franchise (Meteor Garden, Hana Yori Dango and Boys Over Flowers), Hunan TV decided to create a new series based on the same name. It is an unlicensed live-television drama production not authorized by Japanese publisher Shueisha. According to the producer, the series is only inspired by the manga and not based on it.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteor_Shower_(TV_series)</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2024 05:01:34 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
