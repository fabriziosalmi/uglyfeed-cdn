The visible movement of the planet or the planets in the sky appears therefore normally prograde at the first conjunction, retrograde at the second conjunction, and again prograde at the third conjunction.
The lining-up of three planets is a particular case of syzygy.
There are three possible cases of triple conjunctions.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_conjunction</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 05:02:11 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
