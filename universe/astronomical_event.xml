A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A partial solar eclipse occurs in the polar regions of the Earth when the center of the Moon's shadow misses the Earth.
A partial eclipse will be visible for parts of the northeastern United States, eastern Canada, Greenland, Europe, Northwest Africa, and northwestern Russia.
