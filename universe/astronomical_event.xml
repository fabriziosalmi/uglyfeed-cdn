GRB 250702B, the first event, is the longest duration gamma-ray burst ever discovered. The event consisted of three repeated GRB events (250702B, 250702D, and 250702E) lasting several hours from the same astronomical source, implying potential periodicity within the progenitor system.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRB_250702BDE</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:06:53 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
