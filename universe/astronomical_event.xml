The song, a duet with Rory Dodd, became Tyler's biggest career hit, topping the UK Singles Chart, and becoming the fifth-best-selling single in 1983 in the United Kingdom. In the United States, the single spent four weeks at the top of the charts, keeping another Steinman penned song "Making Love Out of Nothing at All" by Air Supply from reaching the top spot (a song Tyler would later cover in 1995), and it was Billboard's number-six song of the year for 1983. The song was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.
Worldwide, the single has sales in excess of six million copies and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of over one million copies after its release, updated to platinum in 2001 when the certification threshold changed. In 2015, the song was voted by the British public as the nation's third favourite 1980s number one in a poll for ITV.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Eclipse_of_the_Heart</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 05:01:40 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
