A solar eclipse is when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the light of the sun for a viewer on earth. A total solar eclipse is when the Moon’s apparent diameter is larger than the Sun’s, blocking all direct sunlight, turning day into night. Totality occurs in a narrow path across Earth’s surface, with the partial solar eclipse visible over a surrounding region thousands of kilometres wide. Occurring about 3.5 days after perigee (on August 8, 1999, at 0:30 UTC), the Moon's apparent diameter was larger.
It was the first total eclipse visible from Europe since July 22, 1990, and the first visible in the United Kingdom since June 29, 1927.
The path of the Moon's shadow began in the Atlantic Ocean and was later traversing the southern United Kingdom and part of the British crown dependency Guernsey, northern France, Belgium, Luxembourg, southern Germany, Austria, extreme northeastern tip of Slovenia, Croatia, Hungary, and northern FR Yugoslavia (Vojvodina). The eclipse's maximum was at 11:03 UTC at 45.1°N 24.3°E﻿ / 45.1; 24.3 in Romania and it continued across Bulgaria, the Black Sea, Turkey, the northeastern tip of Syria, northern Iraq, Iran, southern Pakistan and Srikakulam in India and ended in the Bay of Bengal. A partial eclipse was visible for parts of eastern Canada, Greenland, Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, South Asia, and China.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_August_11,_1999</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Aug 2025 05:01:49 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
