The type and length of a lunar eclipse depend on the Moon's proximity to the lunar node.‍‍ In contrast with illusive and short-lasting solar eclipses, lunar eclipses can be observed from anywhere on the night side of Earth and often last for an hour or longer. Lunar eclipses are safe to observe without eye protection.
Lunar eclipses are notable for causing the Moon to appear orange or red. This occurs when the Moon passes through the Earth's umbra, necessitating any sunlight that reaches the Moon to first pass through the Earth's atmosphere. The resulting Rayleigh scattering removes high-wavelength colors such as violet and blue from the incoming light before it reflects off the lunar surface and is observed on Earth.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_eclipse</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 05:02:10 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
