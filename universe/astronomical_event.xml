Alternatively, an astronomical survey may comprise a set of images, spectra, or other observations of objects that share a common type or feature. Surveys are often restricted to one band of the electromagnetic spectrum due to instrumental limitations, although multiwavelength surveys can be made by using multiple detectors, each sensitive to a different bandwidth.
Surveys have generally been performed as part of the production of an astronomical catalog. They may also search for transient astronomical events. They often use wide-field astrographs.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_survey</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Dec 2024 05:01:40 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
