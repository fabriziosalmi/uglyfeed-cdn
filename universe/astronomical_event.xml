The zenithal hourly rate (ZHR) of this shower can be as high as that of two other reliably rich meteor showers, the Perseids in August and the Geminids in December, yet Quadrantid meteors are not seen as often as those of the two other showers because the time frame of the peak is exceedingly narrow, sometimes lasting only hours. Moreover, the meteors are quite faint, with mean apparent magnitudes between 3.0 and 6.0.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrantids</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2025 05:01:51 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
