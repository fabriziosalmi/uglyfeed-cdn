A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. An annular solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is smaller than the Sun's, blocking most of the Sun's light and causing the Sun to look like an annulus (ring). An annular eclipse appears as a partial eclipse over a region of the Earth thousands of kilometres wide. Occurring only about 3 hours after apogee (on August 28, 1802, at 4:30 UTC), the Moon's apparent diameter was smaller.
The path of annularity was visible from parts of modern-day Greenland, Svalbard, Russia, Mongolia, China, and the Ryukyu Islands. A partial solar eclipse was also visible for parts of Greenland, northern Canada, Europe, Asia, and western Alaska.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_August_28,_1802</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 05:01:42 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
