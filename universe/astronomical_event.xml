A convertible body style was added during the 1996 model year.
The first two generations share the automobile platform and parts with the rebadged Eagle Talon and Plymouth Laser captive imports. They were built during Mitsubishi Motors' close relationship with Chrysler Corporation. Their partnership was known as Diamond-Star Motors (DSM). In Japan, the first two generations were sold at a specific Japanese retail chain called Mitsubishi Car Plaza. The third, 2000â€“2005 generation shared a redesigned platform with the Chrysler Sebring and Dodge Stratus. In May 2005, the fourth, and final generation Eclipse was introduced, replacing the Chrysler platform used for the third generation with the PS platform.
According to Mitsubishi Motors, the Eclipse was named after an unbeaten 18th-century English racehorse that won 18 races in a row and then retired.
At the end of August 2011, the final Eclipse was manufactured and subsequently auctioned for charity.
In 2017, Mitsubishi resurrected the Eclipse name on a compact crossover vehicle, called the Eclipse Cross.
