Simple examples are the recurring cycle of day and night, a consequence of Earth's rotation, and the recurring cycle of the year as the Earth circles the Sun. Requirements for high precision time scales in astronomy have lead to continue refinements in the definition of time.
Some of the time standard scales are sidereal time, solar time, and universal time.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_time</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:26:51 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
