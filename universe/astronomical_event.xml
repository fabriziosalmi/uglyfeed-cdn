The main goal of Adoptium is to promote and support free and open-source high-quality runtimes and associated technology for use across the Java ecosystem. To do so the Adoptium Working Group (WG) builds and provides OpenJDK based binaries under the Eclipse Temurin project. In addition to Temurin the WG creates an open test suite for OpenJDK based binaries as part of the Eclipse AQAvit project.
The Adoptium Working Group was launched by Alibaba Cloud, Huawei, IBM, iJUG, Karakun AG, Microsoft, New Relic, and Red Hat in March 2021.
In May 2022, the Adoptium project announced the formation of the Adoptium Marketplace.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoptium</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jun 2024 05:01:38 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
