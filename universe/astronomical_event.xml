A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is larger than the Sun's, blocking all direct sunlight, turning day into darkness. Totality occurs in a narrow path across Earth's surface, with the partial solar eclipse visible over a surrounding region thousands of kilometres wide. Occurring about 2.5 hours before perigee (on August 2, 2027, at 7:25 UTC), the Moon's apparent diameter will be larger.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_August_2,_2027</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 05:02:11 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
