These are by no means all events, but only the notable or rare ones. In particular, it does not include solar eclipses or lunar eclipses unless otherwise notable, as they are far too numerous to list (see below for articles with lists of all these). Nor does it list astronomical events that have yet to be discovered. Some points of the list miss the last date of the events.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_future_astronomical_events</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 05:01:41 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
