A convertible body style was added during the 1996 model year.
The first two generations were marketed simultaneously as rebadged variants, including the Eagle Talon and Plymouth Laser — and were a byproduct of Mitsubishi Motors and Chrysler Corporation's close alliance. Their partnership in turn gave rise to Diamond-Star Motors (DSM). In Japan, the first two generations were sold at a specific Japanese retail chain called Mitsubishi Car Plaza. The third, 2000–2005 generation shared an extended wheelbase variant of their platform with the Chrysler Sebring and Dodge Stratus. In May 2005, the fourth, and final generation Eclipse was introduced, replacing the Chrysler platform used for the third generation with the PS platform.
According to Mitsubishi, the Eclipse was named after an unbeaten 18th-century English racehorse that won 18 races in a row and then retired.
At the end of August 2011, the final Eclipse was manufactured and auctioned for charity.
In 2017, Mitsubishi resurrected the Eclipse name on a compact crossover vehicle, called the Eclipse Cross.
