The photographs taken during the Bonilla observation are generally regarded as one of the first known examples of photographs of "unidentified flying objects". Though the objects were assumed to be flocks of high-flying geese, astronomers have suggested more recently that Bonilla was observing a nearby comet breaking apart.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonilla_observation</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 05:01:38 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
