Its name is Latin for dragon. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century Greek astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations today. The north pole of the ecliptic is in Draco. Draco is circumpolar from northern latitudes, meaning that it never sets and can be seen at any time of year.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draco_(constellation)</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Dec 2024 05:01:53 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
