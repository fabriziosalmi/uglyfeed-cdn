The area was at the time part of Shaanxi, but is now in Gansu province. A 1994 study in the journal Meteoritics tentatively explained this event as a meteor air burst.
Some historical Chinese accounts of the meteor shower recorded many deaths, but the official Ming dynasty history records the event without mentioning casualties. The casualties are therefore doubted by many researchers in the modern era. In the same year, Asian astronomers coincidentally discovered comet C/1490 Y1, a possible progenitor of the Quadrantid meteor showers.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingyang_event</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2024 05:02:27 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
