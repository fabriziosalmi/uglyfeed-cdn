A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A partial solar eclipse occurred in the polar regions of the Earth when the center of the Moon's shadow misses the Earth.
The partial eclipse was visible for parts of the northeastern United States, eastern Canada, Greenland, Europe, Northwest Africa, and northwestern Russia.
