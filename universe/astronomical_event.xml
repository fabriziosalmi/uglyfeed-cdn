As viewed from a particular vantage point, the transiting body appears to move across the face of the larger body, covering a small portion of it.
The word "transit" refers to cases where the nearer object appears smaller than the more distant object. Cases where the nearer object appears larger and completely hides the more distant object are known as occultations.
However, the probability of seeing a transiting planet is low because it is dependent on the alignment of the three objects in a nearly perfectly straight line. Many parameters of  a planet and its parent star can be determined based on the transit.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_transit</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 05:06:44 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
