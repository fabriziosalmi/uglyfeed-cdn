It was a central lunar eclipse, in which part of the Moon passed through the center of the Earth's shadow. A lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves into the Earth's shadow, causing the Moon to be darkened. A total lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon's near side entirely passes into the Earth's umbral shadow. Unlike a solar eclipse, which can only be viewed from a relatively small area of the world, a lunar eclipse may be viewed from anywhere on the night side of Earth. A total lunar eclipse can last up to nearly two hours, while a total solar eclipse lasts only a few minutes at any given place, because the Moon's shadow is smaller. Occurring about 5.6 days before apogee (on November 14, 2022, at 1:40 UTC), the Moon's apparent diameter was smaller.
This eclipse surpassed the previous eclipse as the longest total lunar eclipse visible from nearly all of North America since August 17, 1989, and until June 26, 2029. A lunar occultation of Uranus happened during the eclipse. It was the first total lunar eclipse on Election Day in US history. This event was referred in media coverage as a "beaver blood moon".
This lunar eclipse was the last of what was almost a tetrad, with the others being on May 26, 2021 (total); November 19, 2021 (partial); and May 16, 2022 (total).
