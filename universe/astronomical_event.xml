It contains constraint solver libraries, a high-level modeling and control language (a superset of Prolog), interfaces to third-party solvers, an integrated development environment and interfaces for embedding into host environments.
ECLiPSe was developed until 1995 at the European Computer‚ÄêIndustry Research Centre (ECRC) in Munich, and then until 2005 at the Centre for Planning and Resource Control at Imperial College London (IC-Parc). It was purchased by Cisco Systems. In September 2006, it was released as open source software under an equivalent of the Mozilla Public License, and is now hosted on SourceForge.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECLiPSe</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2024 05:01:41 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
