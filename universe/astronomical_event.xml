An Eclipse Award Trophy is presented to the winner in each division. The trophy is made by a few small selected American foundries with expertise in studio bronze casting. It is then mounted on the hand-crafted native Kentucky walnut base to comprise the Eclipse Award on which a brass plate recites the award winner. 
The equivalent award in Australia is the Australian Thoroughbred racing awards, in Canada the Sovereign Awards, and in Europe, the Cartier Racing Awards.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_Award</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 05:03:06 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
