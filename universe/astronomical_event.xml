It entered Earth's atmosphere at a speed of 15 kilometres per second (9.3 mi/s) in daylight over Utah, United States (14:30 local time) and passed northwards leaving the atmosphere over Alberta, Canada. It was seen by many people and recorded on film and by space-borne sensors. An eyewitness to the event, located in Missoula, Montana, saw the bolide pass directly overhead and heard a double sonic boom. The smoke trail lingered in the atmosphere for several minutes.
The atmospheric pass modified the object's mass and orbit around the Sun. A 1994 study found that it is probably still in an Earth-crossing orbit and predicted that it would pass close to Earth again in August 1997. However, the object has not been observed again and so its post-encounter orbit remains unknown.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972_Great_Daylight_Fireball</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 05:05:34 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
