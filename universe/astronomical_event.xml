However it could have been a low mass star that has been stripped of its envelope. If the star turns out to be around 3 solar masses, it would be one of the largest stars known to have experienced a tidal disruption event.
The debris from the disrupted star showed relatively high amounts of nitrogen and carbon. These elements were created during the tidal disruption event.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASASSN-14li</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 05:01:47 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
