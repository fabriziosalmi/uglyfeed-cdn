It is the sequel to The Twilight Saga: New Moon (2009) and the third installment in The Twilight Saga film series. The film stars Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, and Taylor Lautner, reprising their roles as Bella Swan, Edward Cullen, and Jacob Black, respectively. Bryce Dallas Howard joins the cast as returning character Victoria, who was previously portrayed by Rachelle Lefevre in the first two films. In the film, Bella further explores her relationships with both Jacob and Edward as the threat of an army of newborn vampires looms over the possibility of an alliance being formed between werewolves and vampires.
Summit Entertainment announced it had greenlit the film on February 20, 2009. Principal photography began on August 17, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and finished on October 31, with post-production beginning early the following month.
