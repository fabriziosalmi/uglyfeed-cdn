A planet is a large, rounded astronomical body that is neither a star nor its remnant. The best available theory of planet formation is the nebular hypothesis, which posits that an interstellar cloud collapses out of a nebula to create a young protostar orbited by a protoplanetary disk. There are eight planets within the Solar System; planets outside of the solar system are also known as exoplanets.

As of 2 October 2025, there are 6,022 confirmed exoplanets in 4,490 planetary systems, with 1,013 systems having more than one planet. Most of these were discovered by the Kepler space telescope. There are an additional 1,979 potential exoplanets from Kepler's first mission yet to be confirmed, as well as 976 from its "Second Light" mission and 4,683 from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_planets</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 05:02:15 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
