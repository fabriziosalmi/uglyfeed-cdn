Due to the immense distances to such worlds, they would be very hard to detect directly. However, indirect evidence suggests that such planets exist. Nonetheless, the most distant known planets are SWEEPS-11 and SWEEPS-04, located in Sagittarius, approximately 27,710 light-years from the Sun, while the Milky Way is about 87,400 light-years in diameter. This means that even galactic planets located further than that distance have not been detected.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extragalactic_planet</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2024 05:01:42 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
