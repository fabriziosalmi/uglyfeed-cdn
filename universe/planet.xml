Apart from the Sun itself, these objects qualify as planets according to common geophysical definitions of that term. The radii of these objects range over three orders of magnitude, from planetary-mass objects like dwarf planets and some moons to the planets and the Sun. This list does not include small Solar System bodies, but it does include a sample of possible planetary-mass objects whose shapes have yet to be determined. The Sun's orbital characteristics are listed in relation to the Galactic Center, while all other objects are listed in order of their distance from the Sun.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gravitationally_rounded_objects_of_the_Solar_System</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2025 05:01:44 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
