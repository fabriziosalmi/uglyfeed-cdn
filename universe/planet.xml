It is part of the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center and is on the campus of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, CA. The archive is funded by NASA and was launched in early December 2011 by the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute as part of NASA's Exoplanet Exploration Program. In June 2019, the archive's collection of confirmed exoplanets surpassed 4,000. (Compare: As of 2 October 2025, there are 6,022 confirmed exoplanets in 4,490 planetary systems, with 1,013 systems having more than one planet.)
The archive's data include published light curves, images, spectra and parameters, and time-series data from surveys that aim to discover transiting exoplanets. The archive also develops Web-based tools and services to work with the data, particularly the display and analysis of transit data sets from the Kepler mission and COnvection ROtation and planetary Transits (CoRoT) mission, for which the Exoplanet Archive is the U.S. data portal. Other astronomical surveys and telescopes that have contributed data sets to the archive include SuperWASP, HATNet Project, XO, Trans-Atlantic Exoplanet Survey and KELT.
According to third-party web analytics provider SimilarWeb, the company's website has over 130,000 visits per month, as of January 2015.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Exoplanet_Archive</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 05:02:11 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
