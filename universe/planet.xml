Neptunian exoplanets may have a mixture of interiors though all would be rocky with heavier metals at their cores. Neptunian planets typically have hydrogen- and helium-dominated atmospheres.
There are several recognized subtypes of Neptunian exoplanets:

Hot Neptune – orbiting close to its star
Helium planet – a hypothetical type that can form from hot Neptune via hydrogen evaporation, leaving a helium-dominated atmosphere
Mini-Neptune – considerably smaller than Neptune but still having a thick hydrogen-helium envelope, relatively common
Super-puff – inflated planets with unusually low mean density
Hycean planet – a hypothetical transitional type to ocean planets with a thin, hydrogen-helium-dominated atmosphere overlaying a liquid water ocean</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptunian_exoplanet</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 05:04:28 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
