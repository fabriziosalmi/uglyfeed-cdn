While most exoplanet science is focused on exoplanetary atmospheric environments, the mass and radius of a planet can tell us about a planet's density, and hence, its internal processes. The internal processes of a planet are partly responsible for its atmosphere, and so they are also a determining factor in a planet's capacity to support life.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet_interiors</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2024 05:01:28 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
