As the definition of planet has evolved, the de facto and de jure definitions of planet have changed over the millennia. As of 2024, there are eight official planets in the Solar System per the International Astronomical Union (IAU), which has also established a definition for exoplanets. Several objects formerly considered exoplanets have been found actually to be stars or brown dwarfs.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_former_planets</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 05:01:39 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
