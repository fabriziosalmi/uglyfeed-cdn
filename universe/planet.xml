Any planet is an extremely faint light source compared to its parent star. For example, a star like the Sun is about a billion times as bright as the reflected light from any of the planets orbiting it. In addition to the intrinsic difficulty of detecting such a faint light source, the glare from the parent star washes it out. For those reasons, very few of the exoplanets reported as of June 2025 have been detected directly, with even fewer being resolved from their host star.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_detecting_exoplanets</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 05:02:13 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
