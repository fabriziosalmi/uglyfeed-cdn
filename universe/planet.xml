Together with one or two other planets in the Proxima Centauri system, it is the closest known exoplanet to the Solar System, located approximately 4.2 light-years (1.3 parsecs; 40 trillion kilometres; 25 trillion miles) away in the constellation of Centaurus. The first signs of the exoplanet emerged as a weak 5.15-day signal in radial velocity data taken from the Very Large Telescope during a 2020 study on Proxima b's mass. This signal was formally proposed to be a candidate exoplanet by Faria et al. in a follow-up paper published in February 2022, and was independently confirmed in 2025.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri_d</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 05:01:57 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
