While most exoplanet science is focused on exoplanetary atmospheric environments, the mass and radius of a planet can tell us about a planet's density, and hence, its internal processes. The internal processes of a planet are partly responsible for its atmosphere, and so they are also a determining factor in a planet's capacity to support life.
As there are over 5,600 different exoplanets and more being discovered every year, it is difficult to group them by interior type. However, NASA has broadly classified them based on their interior and exterior as a gas giant, super earth, Neptune-like, or terrestrial. Within each of these groups are several sub classifications ("hot Jupiter's", "mini-Neptune's", etc.) with many theoretical exoplanet interiors being hypothesized ("chthonian planets", "water worlds", planets with tiny cores or massive mantles, etc.); however, there is no standardized classification of exoplanet interiors.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet_interiors</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2025 05:11:22 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
