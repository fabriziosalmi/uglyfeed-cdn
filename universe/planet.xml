For exoplanets detected only by radial velocity, the mass value is actually a lower limit. (See Minimum mass for more information.)
While the existence of a substellar companion to Gamma Cephei was suspected since 1988, the planet Gamma Cephei Ab was not confirmed until 2003, and that is listed as its discovery year in exoplanet databases. Thus, this planet is in the List of exoplanets discovered between 2000–2009.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_exoplanets_discovered_before_2000</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 05:02:05 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
