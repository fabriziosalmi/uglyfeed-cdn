Death is thought to eventually and inevitably occur in all organisms; though some organisms, such as the immortal jellyfish, are biologically immortal, they can however still die from means other than the effects of aging.  Something that is not considered an organism may be said "to die" in a figurative sense when it reaches an inactive state, such as when a star runs out of fuel.
As of the early 21st century, 56 million people die per year. As of 2022, an estimated total of almost 110 billion humans have died, or roughly 94% of all humans to have ever lived. The cause of death is usually considered important, and an autopsy can be done to determine it. There are many causes, from accidents to diseases or crime and war. The most common reason is aging; the most common cause is cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is a disease that affects the heart or blood vessels.  A substudy of gerontology known as biogerontology seeks to eliminate death by natural aging in humans, often through the application of natural processes found in certain organisms. However, as humans do not have the means to apply this to themselves, they have to use other ways to reach the maximum lifespan for a human, often through lifestyle changes, such as calorie reduction, dieting, and exercise. The idea of lifespan extension is considered and studied as a way for people to live longer.
Determining when a person has definitively died has proven difficult. Initially, death was defined as occurring when breathing and the heartbeat ceased, a status still known as clinical death. However, the development of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) meant that such a state was no longer strictly irreversible. For all organisms with a brain, death can instead be focused on this organ. Brain death was then considered a more fitting option, but several definitions exist for this: some people believe that all brain functions must cease; others believe that even if the brainstem is still alive, the personality and identity are irretrievably lost, so therefore the person should be considered entirely dead. Brain death is sometimes used as a legal definition of death.
Many cultures and religions have a concept of an afterlife. There are also different customs for honoring the lifeless body, such as a funeral, cremation, or sky burial. After a death, an obituary may be posted in a newspaper, and the "survived by" kin and friends usually go through the grieving process.
