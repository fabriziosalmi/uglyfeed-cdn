In this situation, the latter planet is said to be superior to the former. In the reference frame of the Earth, where the terms were originally used, the inferior planets are Mercury and Venus, while the superior planets are Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Dwarf planets like Ceres or Pluto and most asteroids are 'superior' in the sense that they almost all orbit outside the orbit of Earth.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_and_superior_planets</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 05:01:56 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
