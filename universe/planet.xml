The project was launched in April 2017 and reached 26,281 registered volunteers. Two campaigns took place, the first one containing 148,061 images and the second one 56,794 images.
A total of 9 exoplanets were found through the project: K2-138 b, c, d, e, f and g (initially referred to as EE-1b, EE-1c, EE-1d, and EE-1e), K2-233 b, c, and d, and K2-288Bb. K2-288Bb is considered to be potentially habitable with a radius of 1.91 Earth radii and a temperature of 206 K.
Several other candidates in size groups were also found: Jupiters: 44, Neptunes: 72, super-Earths: 53, Earths: 15.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet_Explorers</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 05:01:40 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
