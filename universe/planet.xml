The Solar System belts' size and placement are mostly a result of the Solar System having four giant planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune far from the sun. The giant planets must be in the correct place, not too close or too far from the sun for a system to have Solar System belts.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System_belts</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 05:01:59 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
