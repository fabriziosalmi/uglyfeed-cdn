It is mostly based on estimates of habitability by the Habitable Worlds Catalog (HWC), and data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. The HWC is maintained by the Planetary Habitability Laboratory at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo. 
Surface planetary habitability is thought to require an orbit at the right distance from the host star for liquid surface water to be present, in addition to various geophysical and geodynamical aspects, atmospheric density, radiation type and intensity, and the host star's plasma environment.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_potentially_habitable_exoplanets</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 05:08:26 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
