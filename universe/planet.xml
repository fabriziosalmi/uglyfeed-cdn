At least 19 of them are large enough to be gravitationally rounded; of these, all are covered by a crust of ice except for Earth's Moon and Jupiter's Io. Several of the largest ones are in hydrostatic equilibrium and would therefore be considered dwarf planets or planets if they were in direct orbit around the Sun and not in their current states (orbiting planets or dwarf planets).</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_natural_satellites</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Sep 2025 05:02:06 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
