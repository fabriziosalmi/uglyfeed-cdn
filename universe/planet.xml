It orbits a star in the constellation of Aries and is one of the numerous small exoplanets that populate the "radius valley," a gap in the size distribution of exoplanets that separates rocky super-Earths from gaseous sub-Neptunes. TOI-1846 b is particularly important for ongoing studies of planetary formation and evolution.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOI-1846_b</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:06:49 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
