A planet is a large, rounded astronomical body that is neither a star nor its remnant. The best available theory of planet formation is the nebular hypothesis, which posits that an interstellar cloud collapses out of a nebula to create a young protostar orbited by a protoplanetary disk. There are eight planets within the Solar System; planets outside of the solar system are also known as exoplanets.

As of 24 January 2025, there are 5,830 confirmed exoplanets in 4,354 planetary systems, with 976 systems having more than one planet. Most of these were discovered by the Kepler space telescope. There are an additional 1,982 potential exoplanets from Kepler's first mission yet to be confirmed, as well as 975 from its "Second Light" mission and 4,706 from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission.
