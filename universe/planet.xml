Generally speaking such systems will include planets, and may also include other objects such as dwarf planets, asteroids, natural satellites, meteoroids, comets, planetesimals and circumstellar disks. The Solar System is an example of a planetary system, in which Earth, seven other planets, and other celestial objects are bound to and revolve around the Sun. The term exoplanetary system is sometimes used in reference to planetary systems other than that of the Solar System. By convention planetary systems are named after their host, or parent, star, as is the case with the Solar System being named after "Sol" (Latin for sun).
As of 29 July 2025, there are 6,032 confirmed exoplanets in 4,530 planetary systems, with 989 systems having more than one planet. Debris disks are known to be common while other objects are more difficult to observe.
Of particular interest to astrobiology is the habitable zone of planetary systems where planets could have surface liquid water, and thus, the capacity to support Earth-like life.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_system</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 05:01:59 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
