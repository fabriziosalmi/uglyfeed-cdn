These asteroids comprise approximately 6% of main-belt asteroids and are characterized by their basaltic surface composition, making them distinct from other asteroid types.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-type_asteroid</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 05:02:17 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
