Hildian) are a dynamical group of more than 6,000 asteroids located beyond the asteroid belt but within Jupiter's orbit, in a 3:2 orbital resonance with Jupiter. The namesake is the asteroid 153 Hilda.
Hildas move in their elliptical orbits in such a fashion that they arrive closest to Jupiter's orbit (i.e. at their aphelion) just when either one of Jupiter's L5, L4 or L3 Lagrange points  arrives there. On their next orbit their aphelion will synchronize with the next Lagrange point in the L5–L4–L3 sequence. Since L5, L4 and L3 are 120° apart, by the time a Hilda completes an orbit, Jupiter will have completed 360° − 120° or two-thirds of its own orbit. A Hilda's orbit has a semi-major axis between 3.7 and 4.2 AU (the average over a long time span is 3.97), an eccentricity less than 0.3, and an inclination less than 20°. Two collisional families exist within the Hilda group: the Hilda family and the Schubart family. The namesake for the latter family is 1911 Schubart.
The surface colors of Hildas often correspond to the low-albedo D-type and P-type; however, a small portion are C-type. D-type and P-type asteroids have surface colors, and thus also surface mineralogies, similar to those of cometary nuclei. This implies that they share a common origin.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilda_asteroid</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 05:04:35 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
