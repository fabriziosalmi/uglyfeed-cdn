It describes the deleterious effects of consuming Comet cleanserâ€”a powdered cleansing product.  The most prominent and often-occurring effect in the song is that it turns one's teeth green.  Among other effects alleged by this song are an unappealing taste and, unsurprisingly, a tendency to vomit.
Although this song, like many in its genre, has widely variable lyrics, a common version contains the following words:

Comet - it makes your teeth [or "lips"] turn green!;
Comet - it tastes like gasoline [or "kerosene" in Australia; or "Listerine", in the variation where your lips turn green]!;
Comet - it makes you vomit;
So buy [or "eat" or "get"] some Comet, and vomit, today!
The melody of the song is the "Colonel Bogey March".</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(song)</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 05:06:15 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
