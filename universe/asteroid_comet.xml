The first character is Biron, a sapient horse with magical powers who was once a centaur in ancient Greece. The second character is a shapeshifter with three forms (male, female, and winged centaur). Both characters are connected to the Superman family of titles.
Comet first appeared in the story "The Legion of Super-Traitors!", published in Adventure Comics #293 (February 1962) during the period known as the Silver Age of Comics. This story introduced the Legion of Super-Pets, bringing together several previously established super animals. Krypto the Super-Dog came from Superman's past, Streaky the Supercat and Beppo the Super-Monkey from Superman's present—and Comet was presented as a super-pet who came from the future. The horse was properly introduced seven months later, when Comet met Supergirl in Action Comics #293 (September 1962).
Following Crisis on Infinite Earths (1985), which destroyed the universe and rebooted DC's continuity, the original Comet was no longer considered canon. However, Comet returned to continuity in the limited series Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow (2021–2022), where he sacrificed himself to save Supergirl.
