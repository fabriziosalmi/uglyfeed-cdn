Ephorus reported that it split into two pieces, a larger fragment that is thought to have possibly returned in 1106 AD, as X/1106 C1, and another smaller fragment. While visible from Earth, it was said to have cast shadows at night comparable to a full moon. The Great Comet is thought to possibly be the source of the Kreutz sungrazer family.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Comet_of_371_BC</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 05:02:02 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
