This generally happens when data is insufficient to reliably calculate the comet's location or if the solar elongation is unfavorable near perihelion passage. The D/ designation is used for a periodic comet that no longer exists or is deemed to have disappeared.
Lost comets can be compared to lost asteroids (lost minor planets), although calculation of comet orbits differs because of nongravitational forces, such as emission of jets of gas from the nucleus. Some astronomers have specialized in this area, such as Brian G. Marsden, who successfully predicted the 1992 return of the once-lost periodic comet Swiftâ€“Tuttle.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_comet</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jul 2024 05:01:55 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
