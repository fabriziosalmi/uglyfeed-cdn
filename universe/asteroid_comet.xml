The members of the families are thought to be fragments of past asteroid collisions.  An asteroid family is a more specific term than asteroid group whose members, while sharing some broad orbital characteristics, may be otherwise unrelated to each other.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_family</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 05:01:51 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
