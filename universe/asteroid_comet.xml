These types are thought to correspond to an asteroid's surface composition. For small bodies that are not internally differentiated, the surface and internal compositions are presumably similar, while large bodies such as Ceres and Vesta are known to have internal structure. Over the years, there has been a number of surveys that resulted in a set of different taxonomic systems such as the Tholen, SMASS and Bus–DeMeo classifications.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_spectral_types</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 05:02:36 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
