By definition, Atens are Earth-crossing asteroids (a &lt; 1.0 AU and Q &gt; 0.983 AU). The group is named after 2062 Aten, the first of its kind, discovered on 7 January 1976 by American astronomer Eleanor Helin at Palomar Observatory. As of January 2025, 2,966 Atens have been discovered, of which 271 are numbered, 14 are named, and 197 are classified as potentially hazardous asteroids.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aten_asteroid</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 05:10:44 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
