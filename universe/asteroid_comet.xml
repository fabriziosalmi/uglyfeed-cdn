Described as an enigmatic noise pop outfit brought together by a common love of the Beatles, the original lineup of singer/guitarist Jim Stone, his bassist-brother Neil Stone, guitarist Daniel Huffman, and percussionist Josh Garza entered the studio later that year to cut their debut single "Portrait," produced by Mercury Rev alum David Baker. A deal with the Arista subsidiary Dedicated label followed, they became label mates with Spiritualized, Beth Orton and the Cranes and with Baker again at the helm, Comet recorded their LP bow Chandelier Musings, issued in late 1996. The band toured throughout much of 1995 and 1996 and into early 1997 when fallout from a tour-van accident led to the eventual break up of the original line-up.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(band)</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Oct 2024 05:01:46 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
