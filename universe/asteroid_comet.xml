The group released two studio albums and one live EP before Frehley left the band to release his 1989 solo album, Trouble Walkin'.
The band name was a pun of a pun; Bill Haley &amp; His Comets was a 1950s rock'n'roll band that derived its name as a pun of the typical mispronunciation of Halley's Comet (properly pronounced as "Hal-lee", rhyming with valley, but commonly mispronounced as "Hay-lee"), a comet which orbits the Sun near Earth about every 75 years.  Frehley's surname is commonly misprounced as well: rather than the most frequent pronunciation, "Free-lee", he has explained it is pronounced "Freh-lee" (using a soft 'e' sound) and not "Fray-lee" (using a long 'a' sound).</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frehley%27s_Comet</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 05:02:20 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
