There is controversy about their composition. Traditionally, they were thought to be cytoskeletal elements and to consist primarily of vimentin.  However, more recent research suggested that that was incorrect and that they may be composed of lipids arranged into bilayer membranes.
They were also once thought to be related to centrioles, an organelle involved in cell division in eukaryotes.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_body</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Sep 2024 05:01:46 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
