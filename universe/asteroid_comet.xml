They are distinguished from other asteroids by their non-gravitational acceleration, which causes them to deviate from their expected orbital path. Dark comets were first identified as a distinct class of objects in 2023. They mostly fall into two families, the outer dark comets, and the inner dark comets, which are distinguished by their size and orbital characteristics.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_comet</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:22:57 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
