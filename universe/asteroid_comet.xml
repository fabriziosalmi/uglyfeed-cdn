Comet is an umbrella term, encompassing multiple techniques for achieving this interaction. All these methods rely on features included by default in browsers, such as JavaScript, rather than on non-default plugins. The Comet approach differs from the original model of the web, in which a browser requests a complete web page at a time.
The use of Comet techniques in web development predates the use of the word Comet as a neologism for the collective techniques. Comet is known by several other names, including
Ajax Push,
Reverse Ajax, Two-way-web, HTTP Streaming, and
HTTP server push
among others. The term Comet is not an acronym, but was coined by Alex Russell in his 2006 blog post.
In recent years, the standardisation and widespread support of WebSocket and Server-sent events has rendered the Comet model obsolete.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 05:10:40 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
