Arjunas are near-Earth objects (NEOs) whose orbits are very Earth-like in character, having low inclination, orbital periods close to one year, and low eccentricity. The group is named after Arjuna, a central hero in Hindu historic script Mahabharata. The definition is somewhat more relevant and overlaps the definition of the four well-established Apollo, Amor, Aten and Atira groups. They constitute a dynamically cold group of small NEOs that experience repeated trappings in the 1:1 mean-motion resonance with the Earth.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arjuna_asteroid</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Dec 2024 05:01:41 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
