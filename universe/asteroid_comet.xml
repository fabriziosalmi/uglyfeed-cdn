In a dormant comet, rather than being depleted, any remaining volatile components have been sealed beneath an inactive surface layer. 
Due to the near lack of a coma and tail, an extinct or dormant comet may resemble an asteroid rather than a comet and blur the distinction between these two classes of small Solar System bodies. When volatile materials such as nitrogen, water, carbon dioxide, ammonia, hydrogen and methane in the comet nucleus have evaporated away, all that remains is an inert rock or rubble pile. A comet may go through a transition phase as it comes close to extinction.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinct_comet</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 05:02:04 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
