Notable asteroid mining challenges include the high cost of spaceflight, unreliable identification of asteroids which are suitable for mining, and the challenges of extracting usable material in a space environment.
Asteroid sample return research missions, such as Hayabusa, Hayabusa2, OSIRIS-REx, and Tianwen-2 illustrate the challenges of collecting ore from space using current technology. As of 2024, around 127 grams of asteroid material has been successfully brought to Earth from space. Asteroid research missions are complex endeavors and yield a tiny amount of material (less than 100 milligrams Hayabusa, 5.4 grams Hayabusa2, ~121.6 grams OSIRIS-REx, Tianwen-2 (in progress)) relative to the size and expense of these projects ($300 million Hayabusa, $800 million Hayabusa2, $1.16 billion OSIRIS-REx, $70 million Tianwen-2).
The history of asteroid mining is brief but features a gradual development. Ideas of which asteroids to prospect, how to gather resources, and what to do with those resources have evolved over the decades.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_mining</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 05:02:08 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
