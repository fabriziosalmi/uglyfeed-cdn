As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them.
Blown solar downwind, two separate tails are formed: one composed of dust and the other of gases. They become visible through different phenomena: the dust reflects sunlight directly, and the gases glow from ionization. Most comets are too faint to be visible without the aid of a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_tail</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2024 05:01:39 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
