It was released by Perplexity AI for Microsoft Windows and macOS on July 9, 2025, and for Android on November 20, 2025.
Initially, access to the browser was limited to users subscribed to the most expensive tier, with broader availability expected over time. The browser was later released for free download in October 2025. A key feature of the browser is the integration of the Perplexity search engine, which enables users to perform a variety of tasks such as generating article summaries, describing an image, conducting research about a topic and composing emails.
Some of its key features are: 

a built-in AI agent able to answer questions about open web pages, summarize content, and perform other tasks;
unified search: Perplexity's AI search engine integrated as the default search engine for accurate, verified information;
browser commands allowing users to manage tabs and perform actions using natural language;
contextual awareness: access to browsing history and open pages to retrieve relevant information and learn user habits;
compatibility with most websites; easy import of bookmarks and extensions from other browsers like Google Chrome.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(browser)</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 05:02:15 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
