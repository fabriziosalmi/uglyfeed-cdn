By definition, Atens are Earth-crossing asteroids (a &lt; 1.0 AU and Q &gt; 0.983 AU). The group is named after 2062 Aten, the first of its kind, discovered on 7 January 1976 by American astronomer Eleanor Helin at Palomar Observatory. As of November 2023, 2,646 Atens have been discovered, of which 256 are numbered, 14 are named, and 102 are classified as potentially hazardous asteroids.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aten_asteroid</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2024 05:01:39 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
