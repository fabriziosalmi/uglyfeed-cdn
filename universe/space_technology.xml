Natural satellites are colloquially referred to as moons, a derivation from the Moon of Earth.
In the Solar System, there are six planetary satellite systems, altogether comprising 419 natural satellites with confirmed orbits. Seven objects commonly considered dwarf planets by astronomers are also known to have natural satellites: Orcus, Pluto, Haumea, Quaoar, Makemake, Gonggong, and Eris. As of January 2022, there are 447 other minor planets known to have natural satellites.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 05:02:15 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
