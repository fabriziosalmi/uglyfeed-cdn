The agenda and schedule of presentations is partly or mostly unknown until people begin arriving. The scheduling of speakers, topics and locations is created by people attending, once they arrive. At the end of each OST meeting, a debriefing document is created summarizing what worked and what did not. 
The method was created by Harrison Owen in the early 1980s, as an alternative to pre-planned conferences where speakers are predetermined by conference organizers and time is scheduled often months in advance. OST instead relies on decisions by participants once they are physically present at the live event venue. 
OST was one of the top ten organization development tools cited between 2004 and 2013.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_space_technology</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 05:01:54 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
