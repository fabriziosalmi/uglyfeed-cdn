The fully operational constellation will nominally consist of 30 satellites in Medium Earth Orbit, with 24 active and 6 spares equally divided into 3 orbital planes in a Walker 24/3/1 configuration.
As of September 2024, 32 Galileo (4 In Orbit Validation (IOV) and 28 Full Operational Capability (FOC) satellites have been launched). The 2  Galileo In-Orbit Validation Element (GIOVE) prototype vehicles were retired in 2012. Currently, 27 satellites are operational,  4 are not usable and 1 is decommissioned.
The remaining 6 FOC satellites have completed manufacturing and testing. They are currently in storage awaiting launch by Ariane 6.
FOC satellites were awarded and built in three batches by OHB in Bremen, Germany, with the contribution of Surrey Satellite Technology (SSTL) in Guildford, United Kingdom.

Batch 1 consists of 14 FOC satellites (Galileo-FOC FM1 to Galileo-FOC FM14)
Batch 2 consists of 8 FOC satellites (Galileo-FOC FM15 to Galileo-FOC FM22)
Batch 3 consists of 12 FOC satellites (Galileo-FOC FM23 to Galileo-FOC FM34)
In parallel to Batch 3's completion, the Galileo Second Generation (G2G) satellites, featuring electric propulsion, enhanced navigation signals and capabilities, inter-satellite links and reconfigurability in space, were in development by Thales Alenia Space (TAS) and Airbus Defence and Space, with their deployment expected to begin in 2027.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Galileo_satellites</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 05:03:38 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
