Founded in 2012, Gilmour Space's function is to provide space launch services to the small satellite market using Australian-built Eris orbital rockets, launched from Gilmour’s private spaceport in North Queensland. The company also intends to offer a ride-sharing service, in addition to a modular G-Sat small satellite bus/platform.
The maiden flight of Eris Block 1, which was unveiled by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese as Australia's first sovereign orbital rocket, took place on 30 July 2025 from Bowen Orbital Spaceport at Abbot Point, Bowen, resulting in failure after 14 seconds of flight.
Gilmour Space has long-term ambitions to develop a range of Eris-class launch vehicles capable of carrying larger satellites/payloads into low Earth orbits, and eventually provide space access for crewed orbital missions.
