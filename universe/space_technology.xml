It is one of the global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) that provide geolocation and time information to a GPS receiver anywhere on or near the Earth where signal quality permits. It does not require the user to transmit any data, and operates independently of any telephone or Internet reception, though these technologies can enhance the usefulness of the GPS positioning information. It provides critical positioning capabilities to military, civil, and commercial users around the world. Although the United States government created, controls, and maintains the GPS system, it is freely accessible to anyone with a GPS receiver.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 05:02:06 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
