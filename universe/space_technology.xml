It will be the first radar imaging satellite to use dual frequencies. It will be used for remote sensing, to observe and understand natural processes on Earth. For example, its left-facing instruments will study the Antarctic cryosphere. With a total cost estimated at US$1.5 billion, NISAR is likely to be the world's most expensive Earth-imaging satellite.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NISAR_(satellite)</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 05:02:29 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
