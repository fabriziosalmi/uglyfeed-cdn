The weekly magazine is available in print and online, reporting on the aerospace, defense and aviation industries, with a core focus on aerospace technology. It has a reputation for its contacts inside the United States military and industry organizations.
Aviation Week was a favorite conduit for defense-related companies and labs to leak information to the public as part of their policy by press release efforts. This led to it being informally referred to "Aviation Leak and Space Mythology".</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_Week_%26_Space_Technology</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 05:02:02 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
