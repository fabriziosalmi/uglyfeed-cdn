Powered by three General Electric J85 engines, it was initially designed to maintain a speed of Mach 2.2, with over 1,000 nautical miles (1,900 km; 1,200 mi) of range; but the demonstrator was tested to only Mach 1.1 and no long range flights were ever made. The XB-1 began taxi tests in December 2022, and conducted its maiden flight on March 22, 2024. The aircraft performed its first supersonic flight test on January 28, 2025, being the first privately developed jet aircraft to do so.  It made a second supersonic flight on February 10, 2025, after which the demonstrator aircraft was retired.
