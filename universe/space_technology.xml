It differs from mere suburbs, subdivisions and especially bedroom communities in that it has employment bases sufficient to support its residential population, and conceptually, could be a self-sufficient community outside of its larger metropolitan area. However, it functions as part of a metropolis and experiences high levels of cross-commuting (that is, residents commuting out of and employees commuting into the city).</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_city</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 05:03:26 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
