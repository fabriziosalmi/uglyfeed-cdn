Many of the futuristic craft seen in the productions were originally designed by Thunderbirds special effects director Derek Meddings.
The most prominent vehicles are the five principal rescue craft of the International Rescue organisation: the "Thunderbird machines" (after which the series was named). In the fictional world of Thunderbirds, all of the International Rescue vehicles were designed by Brains, the organisation's resident scientist.
