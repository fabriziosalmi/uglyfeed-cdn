It belongs to the broader field of space geodesy. Traditional astronomical geodesy is not commonly considered a part of satellite geodesy, although there is considerable overlap between the techniques.
The main goals of satellite geodesy are:

Determination of the figure of the Earth, positioning, and navigation (geometric satellite geodesy)
Determination of geoid, Earth's gravity field and its temporal variations (dynamical satellite geodesy or satellite physical geodesy)
Measurement of geodynamical phenomena, such as crustal dynamics and polar motion
Satellite geodetic data and methods can be applied to diverse fields such as navigation, hydrography, oceanography and geophysics.  Satellite geodesy relies heavily on orbital mechanics.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_geodesy</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 05:02:11 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
