There is usually a different map for each transponder (or group of transponders), as each may be aimed to cover different areas.
Footprint maps usually show either the estimated minimum satellite dish diameter required or the signal strength in each area measured in dBW.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footprint_(satellite)</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 05:01:43 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
