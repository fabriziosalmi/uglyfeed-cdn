It uses a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) to determine its geographic position. This location data, along with other vehicle or asset telemetry, is transmitted to an Internet-connected device or a central server using an embedded cellular, radio, or satellite modem. This enables the real-time monitoring and management of vehicles, assets, personnel, and animals from a remote location, and is used in intelligent transportation systems. The global market was valued at over $2.5 billion in 2022 and projected to grow at a CAGR of over 13% to reach $4.76 billion by 2027.
GPS tracking units are used by consumers and are a component of fleet telematics systems and fleet digitalization. Data collected by these devices is typically sent to specialized fleet management software platforms. While many modern vehicles are equipped with a factory-installed telematic control unit (TCU) from the manufacturer, aftermarket GPS tracking units are used to manage mixed fleets (with vehicles from different brands) and to equip vehicles that lack native telematics systems. Specialized hardware manufacturers produce these devices.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_tracking_unit</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:06:54 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
