It belongs to the broader field of space geodesy. Traditional astronomical geodesy is not commonly considered a part of satellite geodesy, although there is considerable overlap between the techniques.: 2 
The main goals of satellite geodesy are:

Determination of the figure of the Earth, positioning, and navigation (geometric satellite geodesy): 3 
Determination of geoid, Earth's gravity field and its temporal variations (dynamical satellite geodesy or satellite physical geodesy)
Measurement of geodynamical phenomena, such as crustal dynamics and polar motion: 4 : 1 
Satellite geodetic data and methods can be applied to diverse fields such as navigation, hydrography, oceanography and geophysics.  Satellite geodesy relies heavily on orbital mechanics.
