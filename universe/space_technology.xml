While all such satellites can be referred to as "small", different classifications are used to categorize them based on mass. Satellites can be built small to reduce the large economic cost of launch vehicles and the costs associated with construction.  Miniature satellites, especially in large numbers, may be more useful than fewer, larger ones for some purposes â€“ for example, gathering of scientific data and radio relay.  Technical challenges in the construction of small satellites may include the lack of sufficient power storage or of room for a propulsion system.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_satellite</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 05:01:50 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
