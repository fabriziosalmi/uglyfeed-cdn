Available initially in two-door hardtop and convertible models, the Satellite remained the top-of-the-line model until the 1967 model year. A station wagon version was added and a higher "Sport" trim introduced.
The Fury name was moved to Plymouth's mid-size models for 1975, at which time the Satellite name was discontinued.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth_Satellite</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 05:02:29 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
