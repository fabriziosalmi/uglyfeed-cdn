Developed by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, the three individual small spacecraft were launched together from the belly of a Lockheed L-1011 aboard the Pegasus XL rocket, on 22 March 2006.  One technology involved antennas that were designed by computers using an evolutionary AI system developed at NASA Ames Research Center.  The ST5 on-board flight computer, the C&amp;DH (Command &amp; Data Handling) system, was based on a Mongoose-V radiation-hardened microprocessor.
On 30 June 2006 the satellites making up ST5 were shut down after successfully completing their technology validation mission.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Technology_5</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 05:01:53 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
