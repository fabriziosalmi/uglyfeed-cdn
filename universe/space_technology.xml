Satellite tracking devices may send special satellite signals that are processed by a receiver.
Locations are stored in the tracking unit or transmitted to an Internet-connected device using the cellular network (GSM/GPRS/CDMA/LTE  or SMS), radio, or satellite modem embedded in the unit or WiFi work worldwide.
GPS antenna size limits tracker size, often smaller than a half-dollar (diameter 30.61 mm). In 2020 tracking is a $2 billion business plus military-in the gulf war 10% or more targets used trackers. Virtually every cellphone tracks its movements.
Tracks can be map displayed in real time, using GPS tracking software and devices with GPS capability.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_tracking_unit</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 05:01:52 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
