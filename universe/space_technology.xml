It includes lunar space probes, but does not include space probes orbiting at the Sun–Earth Lagrangian points (for these, see List of objects at Lagrangian points). A craft is deemed "active" if it is still able to transmit usable data to Earth (regardless of whether it can receive commands).
The craft are further grouped by mission status – "en-route", "mission in progress" or "mission complete" – based on their primary mission. For example, though Voyager 1 is still contactable en-route to the Oort Cloud and has exited the Solar System, it is listed as "mission complete" because its primary task of studying Jupiter and Saturn has been accomplished. Once a probe has reached its first primary target, it is no longer listed as "en route" regardless of whether further travel is involved.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_active_Solar_System_probes</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 05:02:20 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
