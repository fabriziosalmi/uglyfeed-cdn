With select supporting games, the Satellite allows up to four players to play the NES, potentially simultaneously. Additionally, it acts as a wireless range extender adaptor for all wired controllers, with the use of portable, battery-powered, infrared technology. While a normal controller has a range of 7.6 feet, the NES Satellite expands the usable range to 15 feet. A small infrared receiver plugs into the two controller ports on the front of the NES.  The main Satellite unit is powered by six C-cell batteries and must have a line of sight to the receiver.  The unit has four controller ports which accommodate any type of wired NES controllers.  The unit provides "Turbo" selectors for both the A and B buttons.
A similar four-player adaptor called the NES Four Score was released a year later, although it does not allow wireless play.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NES_Satellite</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Dec 2024 05:01:49 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
