This branch campus may be located in a different city, state, or country, and is often smaller than the main campus of an institution. The separate campuses may or may not be under the same accreditation and share resources or they share administrations but maintain separate budgets, resources, and other governing bodies.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_campus</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 05:02:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
