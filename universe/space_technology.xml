Since its foundation in 1987 it focuses on developing microgravity life science research and hardware.
Its current Chief Scientist is Prof. Louis Stodieck and the Center Director is Ms. Stefanie Countryman

BioServe has designed, built and flown over 50 different payloads on over 85 space flight missions including the Space Shuttle, ISS, MIR, Soyuz, and Progress and recently the SpaceX's Dragon capsule and  Orbital's Cygnus spacecraft.
In 2011, BioServe was selected to be the official payload developer for the YouTube Space Lab - a contest where students were able to propose micro gravitational research and BioServe would develop the winner's experiment hardware and perform all of the mission integration and operations work.
BioServe Space Technologies was also the designer of the Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (CGBA) which is a temperature controlled incubator for experiments on cells, microbes, and plants currently in use on the ISS.
In August 2023, BioServe announced that would be collaborating with Sierra Space to grow hematopoietic stem cells in microgravity to research undergoing treatment for blood cancer.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioServe_Space_Technologies</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2024 05:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
