With its headquarters in Paris and a staff of around 2,547 people globally as of 2023, ESA was founded in 1975. Its 2024 annual budget was â‚¬7.8 billion.
ESA's space flight programme includes human spaceflight (mainly through participation in the International Space Station program); the launch and operation of crewless exploration missions to other planets (such as Mars) and the Moon; Earth observation, science and telecommunication; designing launch vehicles; and maintaining a major spaceport, the Guiana Space Centre at Kourou (French Guiana), France. The main European launch vehicle Ariane 6 will be operated through Arianespace with ESA sharing in the costs of launching and further developing this launch vehicle. The agency is also working with NASA to manufacture the Orion spacecraft service module that flies on the Space Launch System.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 05:01:56 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
