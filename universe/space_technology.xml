Satellite DNA is the main component of functional centromeres, and form the main structural constituent of heterochromatin.
The name "satellite DNA" refers to the phenomenon that repetitions of a short DNA sequence tend to produce a different frequency of the bases adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine, and thus have a different density from bulk DNA such that they form a second or "satellite" band(s) when genomic DNA is separated along a cesium chloride density gradient using buoyant density centrifugation.
Sequences with a greater ratio of A+T display a lower density while those with a greater ratio of G+C display a higher density than the bulk of genomic DNA. Some repetitive sequences are ~50% G+C/A+T and thus have buoyant densities the same as bulk genomic DNA. These satellites are called "cryptic" satellites because they form a band hidden within the main band of genomic DNA. "Isopycnic" is another term used for cryptic satellites.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_DNA</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 05:01:46 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
