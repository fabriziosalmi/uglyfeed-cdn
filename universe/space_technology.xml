The Satellite Pro is currently positioned between their consumer E series and their business Tecra series of products.

The earliest models in the series, introduced in the early 1990s, were one of the first to directly compete against IBM's ThinkPad line. Models in Toshiba's Satellite family varied greatly—from entry-level models sold to consumers at major retailers to full-fledged business laptops, with the "Pro" suffix, sold through enterprise channels. In 2016, the Satellite line came to an end when Toshiba exited the consumer personal computer market; in 2020, after Sharp Corporation purchased the computer division as Dynabook, the Satellite Pro was relaunched.
