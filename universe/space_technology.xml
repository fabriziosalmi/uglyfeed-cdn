The spacecraft was designed for astrometry: measuring the positions, distances and motions of stars with unprecedented precision, and the positions of exoplanets by measuring attributes about the stars they orbit such as their apparent magnitude and color. As of May 2025, the mission data processing continues, aiming to construct the largest and most precise 3D space catalog ever made, totalling approximately 1 billion astronomical objects, mainly stars, but also planets, comets, asteroids and quasars, among others.
To study the precise position and motion of its target objects, the spacecraft monitored each of them about 70 times over the five years of the nominal mission (2014–2019), and about as many during its extension. Due to its detectors not degrading as fast as initially expected, the mission was given an extension. As of March 2023, the spacecraft had enough micro-propulsion fuel to operate until the second quarter of 2025. Gaia targeted objects brighter than magnitude 20 in a broad photometric band that covered the extended visual range between near-UV and near infrared; such objects represent approximately 1% of the Milky Way population. Additionally, Gaia was expected to detect thousands to tens of thousands of Jupiter-sized exoplanets beyond the Solar System by using the astrometry method, 500,000 quasars outside this galaxy and tens of thousands of known and new asteroids and comets within the Solar System.
On March 27, 2025, scientists at the ESA switched off Gaia after more than a decade of service, sending it into orbit around the sun and overwriting some of its onboard data. 
The Gaia mission continues to create a precise three-dimensional map of astronomical objects throughout the Milky Way and map their motions, which encode the origin and subsequent evolution of the Milky Way. The spectrophotometric measurements provide detailed physical properties of all stars observed, characterizing their luminosity, effective temperature, gravity and elemental composition. This massive stellar census is providing the basic observational data to analyze a wide range of important questions related to the origin, structure and evolutionary history of the Milky Way galaxy.
The successor to the Hipparcos mission (operational 1989–1993), Gaia is part of ESA's Horizon 2000+ long-term scientific program. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 by Arianespace using a Soyuz ST-B/Fregat-MT rocket flying from Kourou in French Guiana. The spacecraft currently operates in a Lissajous orbit around the Sun–Earth L2 Lagrangian point. The science observation officially ended on 15 January 2025.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_(spacecraft)</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jun 2025 05:02:35 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
