It was the first-ever recall of a genetically modified food. The anti-GMO activist coalition Genetically Engineered Food Alert, which detected and first reported the contamination, was critical of the FDA for not doing its job.  The recall of Taco Bell-branded taco shells, manufactured by Kraft Foods and sold in supermarkets, was the most publicized of the recalls. One settlement resulted in $60 million going to Taco Bell franchisees for lost sales due to the damage to the Taco Bell brand.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarLink_corn_recall</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 05:02:08 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
