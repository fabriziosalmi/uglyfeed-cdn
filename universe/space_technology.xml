This branch campus may be located in a different location, city, state, or country, and is often smaller than the primary campus of an institution. A satellite campus may or may not share the same accreditation, administrative structures, budgets, resources, and governance as the main campus.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_campus</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:29:01 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
