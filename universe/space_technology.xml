The agenda and schedule of presentations are partly or mostly unknown until people begin arriving. The scheduling of speakers, topics, and locations is created by people attending once they arrive. A debriefing document is created at the end of each OST meeting, summarizing what worked and what did not.
Harrison Owen created the method in the early 1980s as an alternative to pre-planned conferences, where conference organizers predetermined speakers and time was often scheduled months in advance. OST instead relies on decisions made by participants once they are physically present at the live event venue.
OST was among the top ten organizational development tools cited between 2004 and 2013.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_space_technology</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 05:02:55 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
