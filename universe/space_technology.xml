Modern consumer grade satellite Internet service is typically provided to individual users through geostationary satellites that can offer relatively high data speeds, with newer satellites using the Ku band to achieve downstream data speeds up to 506 Mbit/s. In addition, new satellite internet constellations are being developed in low-earth orbit to enable low-latency internet access from space.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_Internet_access</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2024 05:01:41 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
