Kookoolis and Scott Fagan, lyrics by Fagan, and a book by Martin Duberman and Robert Greenwald. It is based on a story by Fagan and Kookoolis.
The story is about a group of young musicians who achieve success in New York City, but pay the price. It was an attack on the record industry, which apparently caused Fagan and Kookoolis to be blacklisted.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soon_(musical)</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Aug 2024 05:01:54 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
