The album was planned to be released on 19 April, but was pushed back by the record label, Hassle. The band had begun recording demos for the record in the first week of October 2009 and wasted no time in recording the tracks professionally in Los Angeles during the second and third weeks of the same month. The album was produced by Diplo.
B-sides for singles from the album include "The Golden Ghost", which was released on 28 April via the "2010 Subs Club". "Party Wounds" is the A-side to this release.
"Party Wounds" was the first song from Cosmology to have a video.
