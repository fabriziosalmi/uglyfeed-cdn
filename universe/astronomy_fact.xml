In CCC, the universe iterates through infinite cycles, with the future timelike infinity (i.e. the latest end of any possible timescale evaluated for any point in space) of each previous iteration being identified with the Big Bang singularity of the next. Penrose popularized this theory in his 2010 book Cycles of Time: An Extraordinary New View of the Universe.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_cyclic_cosmology</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:26:40 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
