The oldest and only permanently-established chair was founded in 1909, and is currently held at the Institute of Astronomy.
The creation of the 1909 professorship in Cambridge marked the formal recognition of the relatively new subject of Astrophysics.  It was without a stipend until 1928, when the first holder Hugh Newall endowed it on his retirement.
