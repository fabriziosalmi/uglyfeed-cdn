In the astronomy of the medieval Islamic world, with a few additions, the collection became known as the Middle Books (Arabic: كتاب المتوسطات Kitāb al-mutawassiṭāt), mathematical preparation for Claudius Ptolemy's Almagest, intended for students who had already studied Euclid's Elements.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Astronomy</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 05:01:46 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
