According to this scenario, our Universe was born as a child universe in a black hole existing in a larger parent universe, where this black hole appears as the only white hole.  The non-singular Big Bounce, at which the Universe had a non-zero, minimum scale factor, is regarded as the Big Bang. All universes created by black holes form the multiverse.
During gravitational collapse of most massive stars and centers of galaxies, a black hole forms.  The matter in a black hole continues to contract.  At extremely high densities, much larger than the density of nuclear matter, torsion or any other mechanism limiting curvature prevents the matter from compressing indefinitely to a singularity.  Instead, the collapsing matter reaches a state with an extremely large but finite density, stops collapsing, undergoes a bounce, and starts rapidly expanding into a new space, which is equivalent to a new, expanding universe on the other side of the black hole's event horizon.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_cosmology</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 05:02:11 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
