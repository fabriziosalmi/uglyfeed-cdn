This includes literature from the period of Second Temple Judaism (516 BCE – 70 CE), rabbinic literature, para-rabbinic literature (notably including Pirkei De-Rabbi Eliezer), and more.
Jewish cosmology may be treated separately from biblical cosmology which refers to the views concerning the origins (cosmogony) and structure (cosmography) of the cosmos in the Hebrew Bible.
