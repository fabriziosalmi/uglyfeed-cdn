It includes X-ray astronomy, gamma-ray astronomy, extreme UV astronomy, neutrino astronomy, and studies of cosmic rays.  The physical study of these phenomena is referred to as high-energy astrophysics.
Astronomical objects commonly studied in this field may include black holes, neutron stars, active galactic nuclei, supernovae, kilonovae, supernova remnants, and gamma-ray bursts.
