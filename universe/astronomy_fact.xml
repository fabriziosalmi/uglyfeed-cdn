More generally, it relates to the usage or appearance of fractals in the study of the universe and matter. A central issue in this field is the fractal dimension of the universe or of matter distribution within it, when measured at very large or very small scales.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_cosmology</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 05:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
