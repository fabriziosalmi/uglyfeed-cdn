The report surveys the current state of the field, identifies research priorities, and makes recommendations for the coming decade. The decadal survey represents the recommendations of the research community to governmental agencies on how to prioritize scientific funding within astronomy and astrophysics. The editing committee is informed by topical panels and subcommittees, dedicated conferences, and direct community input in the form of white papers summarizing the state of the art in each subdiscipline. The most recent report, Astro2020, was released in 2021.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy_and_Astrophysics_Decadal_Survey</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Aug 2024 05:01:35 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
