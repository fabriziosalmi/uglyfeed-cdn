It is a relatively new field of research emerging at the intersection of particle physics, astronomy, astrophysics, detector physics, relativity, solid state physics, and cosmology. Partly motivated by the discovery of neutrino oscillation, the field has undergone rapid development, both theoretically and experimentally, since the early 2000s.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroparticle_physics</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Aug 2025 05:01:39 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
