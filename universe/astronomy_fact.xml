It was released on September 11, 2018 by W. W. Norton &amp; Company. The book chronicles war and the use of space as a weapon going as far back as before the Ancient Greeks, and includes examples such as Christopher Columbus' use of his knowledge of a lunar eclipse and the use of satellite intelligence by the United States during the Gulf War. While speaking on the book, Tyson told National Geographic that he regards the collaboration between science and the military as a "two-way street."
Marcelo Gleiser wrote that the book "rings like a wake-up call, even if an uncomfortable one."</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessory_to_War</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2024 05:01:42 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
