It includes X-ray astronomy, gamma-ray astronomy, extreme UV astronomy, neutrino astronomy, and studies of cosmic rays.  The physical study of these phenomena is referred to as high-energy astrophysics.
Astronomical objects commonly studied in this field may include black holes, neutron stars, active galactic nuclei, supernovae, kilonovae, supernova remnants, and gamma-ray bursts.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-energy_astronomy</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Aug 2024 05:01:33 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
