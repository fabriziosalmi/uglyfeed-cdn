Ultraviolet light is not visible to the human eye. Most of the light at these wavelengths is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, so observations at these wavelengths must be performed from the upper atmosphere or from space.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_astronomy</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 05:05:34 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
