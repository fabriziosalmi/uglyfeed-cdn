Astronomers place the submillimetre waveband between the far-infrared and microwave wavebands, typically taken to be between a few hundred micrometres and a millimetre. It is still common in submillimetre astronomy to quote wavelengths in 'microns', the old name for micrometre.
Using submillimetre observations, astronomers examine molecular clouds and dark cloud cores with a goal of clarifying the process of star formation from earliest collapse to stellar birth.  Submillimetre observations of these dark clouds can be used to determine chemical abundances and cooling mechanisms for the molecules which comprise them.  In addition, submillimetre observations give information on the mechanisms for the formation and evolution of galaxies.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submillimetre_astronomy</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2024 05:01:36 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
