Like black holes themselves, binary black hole systems are classified as either stellar-mass—involving remnants of high-mass binary star systems or formed by dynamic processes and mutual capture—or supermassive, black hole systems believed to arise from galactic mergers.
The existence of stellar-mass binary black holes was directly confirmed by gravitational wave observation in September 2015. Supermassive binary black hole candidates have been proposed based on indirect evidence, but await observational confirmation.
