The terms can be joking, sincerely held identities, or stereotypes within the LGBT community. When used sincerely, the terms have been criticised as exclusionary towards bisexuality and other experiences of gender and sexuality, and as stigmatising survivors of sexual violence.
The related term "gold star asexual" refers not to past sexual experience, but to a hypothetical asexual person whose asexuality cannot be attributed to trauma, disability or other external factors.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_star_(LGBT_slang)</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Aug 2024 05:01:37 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
