It was released on May 19, 2023 as the sixth single from Roan's debut studio album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess. The song began charting in 2024, following the success of "Good Luck, Babe!".
About the song, Roan said, "I needed a campy gay girl song that captured the magic of having feelings for another girl. I packed the song with fun raunchy lyrics that make it feel like a night out flirting with the girl across the bar." A pop, synth-pop, dance-pop, and electro song that evokes new wave, Roan has referred to the song as "the gay girl version" of "Champagne Supernova" by Oasis. In an interview with Australian radio station Joy 94.9, Roan said the song took three years to complete and called it "the ultimate silly pop" song.
The song became a sleeper hit in 2024, as one of Roan's seven simultaneously charting songs on the Billboard Hot 100, along with "Good Luck, Babe!", "Casual", "Hot to Go!", "Pink Pony Club", "Femininomenon", and "My Kink Is Karma".</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Wine_Supernova</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 05:02:02 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
