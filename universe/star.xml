The X-rays are produced by matter falling from one component, called the donor (usually a relatively common main sequence star), to the other component, called the accretor, which can be a white dwarf, neutron star or black hole. 
The infalling matter releases gravitational potential energy, up to 30 percent of its rest mass, as X-rays.  (Hydrogen fusion releases only about 0.7 percent of rest mass.)  The lifetime and the mass-transfer rate in an X-ray binary depends on the evolutionary status of the donor star, the mass ratio between the stellar components, and their orbital separation.
An estimated 1041 positrons escape per second from a typical low-mass X-ray binary.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_binary</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 05:06:13 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
