Any stars in the universe can collide, whether they are "alive", meaning fusion is still active in the star, or "dead", with fusion no longer taking place. White dwarf stars, neutron stars, black holes, main sequence stars, giant stars, and supergiants are very different in type, mass, temperature, and radius, and accordingly produce different types of collisions and remnants.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_collision</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Aug 2024 05:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
