It is part of the Star Wars franchise, taking place after the events of Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008–2020), and follows former Sith lord Maul during the reign of the Galactic Empire.
Sam Witwer voices Maul, reprising his role from The Clone Wars and other Star Wars media, with Gideon Adlon, Wagner Moura, and Richard Ayoade also providing voices. Maul – Shadow Lord was announced in April 2025, a year after Witwer joined to provide insight on the character as well as his voice. The series is produced by Lucasfilm Animation, with Matt Michnovetz as head writer, Brad Rau as supervising director, and Filoni, Michnovetz, Rau, Athena Yvette Portillo, Carrie Beck, and Josh Rimes as executive producers. It tells a serialized story and explores questions about Maul that Filoni and Witwer discussed while working on previous series. The animation, provided by CGCG, Inc. and Lucasfilm Animation's internal team, has a similar style to The Clone Wars but is more stylized, reflecting Maul's character and the setting of the planet Janix.
The 10-episode series is scheduled to premiere on Disney+ on April 6, 2026, with two episodes being released each week until May 4.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Maul_%E2%80%93_Shadow_Lord</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:22:11 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
