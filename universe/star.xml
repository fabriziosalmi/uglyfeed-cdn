It was written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards.  In a few select countries, the song was released as a single from the band's album Goats Head Soup (1973), with "Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker)" as its B-side. The song's title was changed to "Star Star" from "Starfucker" after Ahmet Erteg√ºn of Atlantic Records insisted on the change.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Star</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 05:01:42 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
