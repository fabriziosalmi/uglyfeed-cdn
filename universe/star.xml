Supernova remnants typically only survive for a few tens of thousands of years, making all known SNRs fairly young compared to many other astronomical objects.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_supernova_remnants</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 05:02:04 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
