Like supernovae, SLSNe seem to be produced by several mechanisms, which is readily revealed by their light-curves and spectra. There are multiple models for what conditions may produce an SLSN, including core collapse in particularly massive stars, millisecond magnetars, interaction with circumstellar material (CSM model), or pair-instability supernovae.
The first confirmed superluminous supernova connected to a gamma ray burst was not found until 2003, when GRB 030329 illuminated the Leo constellation. SN 2003dh represented the death of a star 25 times more massive than the Sun, with material being blasted out at over a tenth the speed of light.
Stars with M ≥ 40 M☉ are likely to produce superluminous supernovae.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superluminous_supernova</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 05:02:46 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
