It is owned by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, a subsidiary of Torstar Corporation and part of Torstar's Daily News Brands division.
The newspaper was established in 1892 as the Evening Star and was later renamed the Toronto Daily Star in 1900, under Joseph E. Atkinson. Atkinson was a major influence in shaping the editorial stance of the paper, with the paper reflecting his principles until his death in 1948. His son-in-law, Harry C. Hindmarsh, shared those principles as the paper's longtime managing editor while also helping to build circulation with sensational stories, bold headlines and dramatic photos. The paper was renamed the Toronto Star in 1971 and introduced a Sunday edition in 1977.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Star</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 05:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
