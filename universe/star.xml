It is the fourth installment in the Honkai series, utilizing some characters from Honkai Impact 3rd and some gameplay elements from Genshin Impact. The game features the main character, who is referred to as the Trailblazer, traveling across planets through the Astral Express to help and connect the worlds while resolving disasters caused by "Stellarons" and other third parties.
The first closed beta test was launched on October 27, 2021. It was publicly released internationally on April 26, 2023 for Windows and mobile devices. Additionally, the PlayStation 5 port was released on October 11, 2023. The PlayStation 4 version is still yet to be announced, as revealed at the 2023 Summer Game Fest with a trailer.
Partially due to the popularity of Genshin Impact, the game was widely anticipated before its launch. It was nominated for the Most Wanted Game Award at the Golden Joystick Awards in 2022, won the Best Popularity Award of World Science Fiction Game Annual Awards in 2023, and Best Mobile Game Award in the Game Awards 2023.
