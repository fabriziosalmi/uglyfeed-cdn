It is generally used in the context of neutron star and black hole accretion. To achieve an approximate form of the Bondi accretion rate, accretion is assumed to occur at a rate

 is the Bondi radius, defined as 
  
    
      
        2
        G
        M
        
          /

.
The Bondi radius comes from setting escape velocity equal to the sound speed and solving for radius. It represents the boundary between subsonic and supersonic infall. Substituting the Bondi radius in the above equation yields:

  
    
      
        
          
            
              M

                G

                M
                
                  2
                
              
            
            
              c
              
                s
              
              
                3
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\dot {M}}\simeq {\frac {\pi \rho G^{2}M^{2}}{c_{s}^{3}}}}
  
.
These are only scaling relations rather than rigorous definitions. A more complete solution can be found in Bondi's original work and two other papers.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bondi_accretion</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2025 05:01:44 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
