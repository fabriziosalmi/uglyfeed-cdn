They are created as a result of supernovas and gravitational collapse, and are the second smallest and densest class of stellar objects. In the cores of these stars, protons and electrons combine to form neutrons. Neutron stars can be classified as pulsars if they are magnetized, if they rotate, and if they emit beams of electromagnetic radiation out of their magnetic poles.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neutron_stars</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2024 05:01:53 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
