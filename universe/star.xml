It is the 12th Star Trek series and part of executive producer Alex Kurtzman's expanded Star Trek Universe. Set in the 32nd century, the far-future time period that was introduced in the series Star Trek: Discovery (2017–2024), Starfleet Academy follows the first new class of Starfleet cadets in over a century as they come of age and train to be officers.
Sandro Rosta, Karim Diané, Kerrice Brooks, George Hawkins, and Bella Shepard portray Starfleet Academy cadets, starring alongside Holly Hunter, Zoë Steiner, Robert Picardo, Tig Notaro, and Oded Fehr. Versions of a Starfleet Academy-based series were in development for years before it received an official series order in March 2023, with Kurtzman and Noga Landau as showrunners. Production on the first season took place from August 2024 to February 2025 at Pinewood Toronto Studios in Toronto, Canada, and production on the second season began in August 2025.
Star Trek: Starfleet Academy premiered on the streaming service Paramount+ on January 15, 2026, with its first two episodes. The other eight episodes of the first season will be released weekly until March 12.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Starfleet_Academy_(TV_series)</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:06:50 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
