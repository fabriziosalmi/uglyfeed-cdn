Definitions vary, but typically require the center of mass to be located outside of either object. (See animated examples.)
The most common kinds of binary system are binary stars and binary asteroids, but brown dwarfs, planets, neutron stars, black holes and galaxies can also form binaries.
A multiple system is similar but consists of three or more objects, for example triple stars and triple asteroids (a more common term than 'trinary').</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_system</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jun 2025 05:02:31 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
