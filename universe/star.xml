The album was self-released, with only 1,000 copies printed. A rearranged, remixed version was created the following year, Masters of the Universe, with wider distribution.
The entire album was recorded, mixed and mastered on a $500 budget.  Consequently, all verses were recorded in one take.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterworld_(Binary_Star_album)</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 05:01:55 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
