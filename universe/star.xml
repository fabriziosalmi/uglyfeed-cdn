A binary number  may also refer to a rational number that has a finite representation in the binary numeral system, that is, the quotient of an integer by a power of two.
The base-2 numeral system is a positional notation with a radix of 2. Each digit is referred to as bit, or binary digit. Because of its straightforward implementation in digital electronic circuitry using logic gates, the binary system is used by almost all modern computers and computer-based devices, as a preferred system of use, over various other human techniques of communication, because of the simplicity of the language and the noise immunity in physical implementation.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2024 05:01:42 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
