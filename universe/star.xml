The service star may also be referred to as a campaign star or battle star depending on which award the star is authorized for and the manner in which the device is used for the award. "Battle star" is also the term used to refer to decorations issued by the United States Navy during World War II and the Korean War to individual ships, recognizing a vessel's participation in a particular battle or operation.

Service stars, campaign stars, and battle stars are worn with one point of the star pointing up on the suspension ribbon of a medal or service ribbon. A silver star is worn instead of five bronze stars. A service star is sometimes mistaken for a Bronze Star (Bronze Star Medal) or Silver Star (Silver Star Medal). The service star is also similar to the gold and silver 5⁄16 -inch stars that may be authorized to be worn on specific individual decorations of certain services to denote additional decorations.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_star</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2025 05:04:13 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
