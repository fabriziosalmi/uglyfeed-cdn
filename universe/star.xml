The film features Vijay Deverakonda and Mrunal Thakur in lead roles.
The film was officially announced in February 2023 under the tentative title VD11, as it is Vijay's 11th film as the lead actor, and the official title was announced in October 2023. Principal photography commenced in July 2023. It was shot sporadically in several legs, with filming locations including Hyderabad and New York. The film has music composed by Gopi Sundar.
Family Star was initially scheduled to release on Sankranthi but it was postponed to avoid clash with Sankranthi films. The Family Star received generally negative reviews from critics, who heavily criticised Parasuram's writing and direction, weak comedy, plot, predictability, soundtrack, and the lead cast's performances. The film was a box office bomb grossing ₹19.78–23.20 crore against budget of ₹50 crore.
