"folk houses") are vernacular houses constructed in any one of several traditional Japanese building styles.
In the context of the four divisions of society, Minka were the dwellings of farmers, artisans, and merchants (i.e., the three non-samurai castes). This connotation no longer exists in the modern Japanese language, and any traditional Japanese-style residence of appropriate age could be referred to as Minka.

Minka are characterized by their basic structure, their roof structure, and their roof shape. Minka developed through history with distinctive styles emerging in the Edo period.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minka</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 05:04:41 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
