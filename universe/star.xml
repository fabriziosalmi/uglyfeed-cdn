Named after the serpent deity from Egyptian mythology, the star system is surrounded by a vast complex of stellar wind and cosmic dust thrown into space by the high rotation speed of the binary's primary star and formed into a "pinwheel" shape by the secondary star's influence. Ground-based studies of the system in the 2010s concluded that the system was the best-known gamma-ray burst progenitor candidate in the Milky Way galaxy.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apep_(star_system)</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:07:18 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
