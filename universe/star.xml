Produced by Legendary Pictures and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, it is a sequel to Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire (2024), the sixth Godzilla film to be completely produced by a Hollywood studio, and the sixth film in the Monsterverse franchise, also serving as the 39th film of the Godzilla franchise and 14th in the King Kong franchise. The film stars Kaitlyn Dever, Dan Stevens, Jack O'Connell, Matthew Modine, Delroy Lindo, Alycia Debnam-Carey, and Sam Neill, with Stevens reprising his role from the previous film.
Following the success of Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire in March 2024, a sequel was announced the following May. Sputore was hired to direct the following month, after Adam Wingard, who previously directed Godzilla vs. Kong and Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, would not return to direct a third film featuring Godzilla and Kong due to scheduling conflicts. Principal photography commenced in April 2025 at Village Roadshow Studios in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia.
The film is slated to be released on March 26, 2027.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla_x_Kong:_Supernova</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 05:02:06 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
