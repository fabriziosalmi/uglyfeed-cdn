Wilson, William Malone and Daniel Chuba and directed by Walter Hill, credited as "Thomas Lee." 
"Thomas Lee" was chosen as a directorial pseudonym for release in lieu of Alan Smithee, as the latter had become too well known as a badge of a film being disowned by its makers. It was originally developed in 1988 by Malone as "Dead Star," with paintings by H. R. Giger and a plot that had been called "Hellraiser in outer space." Jack Sholder was hired for substantial uncredited reshoots, and Francis Ford Coppola was brought in for editing purposes. Various sources suggest that little of Hill's work remains in the theatrical cut of the film. The film shares several plot similarities with the film Event Horizon, released in 1997, and Alien Cargo, released in 1999. The cast features James Spader, Angela Bassett, Robert Forster, Lou Diamond Phillips, Peter Facinelli, Robin Tunney, and Wilson Cruz. The film was shot by cinematographer Lloyd Ahern II and scored by composers David C. Williams and Burkhard Dallwitz.
Released on January 14, 2000, the film was panned by critics, who criticized the story, characters, pacing and effects, and was a box-office bomb, only grossing $14.8 million over its budget between $60â€’90 million during its theatrical release, with an estimated loss of $83 million.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova_(2000_film)</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 05:01:55 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
