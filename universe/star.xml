The series was first broadcast from 1966 to 1969. Since then, the Star Trek canon has expanded to include many other series, a film franchise, and other media.
The film franchise is produced by Paramount Pictures and began with Star Trek: The Motion Picture in 1979. That film and the five that followed all starred the cast of The Original Series. The seventh film, Star Trek Generations (1994), was designed to serve as a transition from the original cast to that of the next series, Star Trek: The Next Generation. The next three films just starred the cast of The Next Generation, and ended with Star Trek: Nemesis (2002), which disappointed at the box office.
After a break of several years, a new film simply titled Star Trek was released in 2009. It serves as a reboot of the franchise, with new actors portraying younger versions of the Original Series characters, but it is technically a narrative continuation set in an alternate timeline called the "Kelvin Timeline". Two sequels have been produced and another entered development, but was ultimately canceled. The first television film, Star Trek: Section 31, was released on the streaming service Paramount+ in 2025 and is set in the original timeline. A new feature film, separate from previous takes, is in development.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Star_Trek_films</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:04:17 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
