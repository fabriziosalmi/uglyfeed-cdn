The Supernova features a recoil reducer, which is attached to the interior of the stock, and raises the length of time that the shot's impulse is spread across, thus lowering felt recoil.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benelli_Supernova</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 05:01:50 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
