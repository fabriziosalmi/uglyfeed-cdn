An estimated 20 supernova explosions have happened within 300 pc of the Earth over the last 11 million years. Type II supernova explosions are expected to occur in active star-forming regions, with 12 such OB associations being located within 650 pc of the Earth. At present, there are 12 near-Earth supernova candidates within 300 pc.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-Earth_supernova</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 05:01:38 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
