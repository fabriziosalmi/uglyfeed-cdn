Appearing in 1604, it is the most recent supernova in the Milky Way galaxy to have been unquestionably observed by the naked eye, occurring no farther than 6 kiloparsecs (20,000 light-years) from Earth. Before the adoption of the current naming system for supernovae, it was named for Johannes Kepler, the German astronomer who described it in De Stella Nova.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_Supernova</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jun 2024 05:01:55 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
