In 2002, Karl Glazebrook and Ivan Baldry determined that the average color of the universe was a whiteish green, but they soon corrected their analysis in a 2003 paper in which they reported that their survey of the light from over 200,000 galaxies averaged to a whiteish beige. The hex triplet value (assuming the standard sRGB color space) for the cosmic latte color is approximately #FFF8E7.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_latte</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 05:02:35 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
