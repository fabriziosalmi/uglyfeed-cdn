Hassan was born in Saudi Arabia. In 2009, he received a BSc in Physics from the University of Khartoum, Sudan. In 2013, he received an MSc in Astrophysics &amp; Space Science from the University of Cape Town, South Africa, and a PhD from the University of the Western Cape, South Africa. During his PhD studies, Hassan became a visiting fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics until 2017. In 2018, he became a Square Kilometre Array Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Western Cape, followed by a Tombaugh Postdoctoral Fellow at New Mexico State University from 2018 to 2020. In September 2020, he became Flatiron Research Fellow at the Flatiron Institute. In 2022, Hassan was selected for NASA Hubble Fellowship Program as a Hubble Fellow hosted at New York University.
Hassan specialises in computational astrophysics, focusing on large-scale galaxy formation and high-resolution radiative-transfer simulations coupled with machine learning and Bayesian inference techniques for multimodal information extraction and understanding of how the Intergalactic and Circumgalactic media both had evolved from Cosmic Dawn.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan_Hassan_(astrophysicist)</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2025 05:01:54 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
