Schramm was a pioneer in establishing particle astrophysics as a vibrant research field.  He was particularly well known for the study of Big Bang nucleosynthesis and its use as a probe of dark matter (both baryonic and non-baryonic) and of neutrinos. He also made important contributions to the study of cosmic rays, supernova explosions, heavy-element nucleosynthesis, and nuclear astrophysics generally.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Schramm_(astrophysicist)</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2024 05:02:01 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
