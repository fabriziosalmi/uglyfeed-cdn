Ross obtained his Ph.D. in astronomy from the University of Toronto and his B.Sc. degree in physics from the University of British Columbia. He established his own ministry in 1986, called Reasons to Believe.
Ross rejects both abiogenesis and evolution as explanations for the origin and history of life, contrary to the scientific consensus. Ross' position overlaps with that of intelligent design, but Ross argues that the evidence points to Jesus Christ as the designer, instead of an undefined intelligent designer.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Ross_(astrophysicist)</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 05:01:47 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
