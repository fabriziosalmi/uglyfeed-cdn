Lee received his B.S in Physics at National Tsing Hua Univ. and received his PhD in astronomy at the University of Texas in 1977.
He specializes in key research areas encompassing chondrules, mineralogy, Allende meteorite, chondrites, and astrophysics. Within mineralogy, his focus extends to subjects like seawater, directly linked to disciplines such as coral and Porites. Notably, his work delves into analytical chemistry, stable isotope ratios, and magnesium isotopes within the framework of Allende meteorite investigations.
His honors include the Robert J. Trumpler Award in 1978 from the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, and Outstanding Researcher Awards from the National Science Council in 1985-87 and once again 1988–90.
A selection of his publications includes:

X-wind, Refractory IDPs and Cometary Nuclei, 1999, in Proc. IAU Colloquium 168, Astro. Soc. Pacific, San Francisco.
Proto-stellar Cosmic Rays and Extinct Radioactivities in Meteorites, 1998, Ap. J. 506, 898–912.
