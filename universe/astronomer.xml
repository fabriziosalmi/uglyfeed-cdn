They made refracting telescopes and instruments for observatories, and were involved in the origin of the Carte du Ciel project.
Between the two of them, they discovered a total of 14 asteroids.  The Minor Planet Center credits their discoveries under "P. P. Henry" and "P. M. Henry", respectively. The lunar crater Henry Frères (Henry brothers) and the Martian crater Henry are named after them. They were jointly awarded the first Valz Prize in 1877 for their sky charts designed to facilitate the search for minor planets.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Henry_and_Prosper_Henry</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 05:02:03 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
