C. S. Brainin was the first editor; a section called "Meteor Notes" was edited by Virginia Geiger starting in 1933.
In 1935, The Amateur Astronomer merged into The Sky published by the Hayden Planetarium. In 1941, The Sky merged with The Telescope to become Sky &amp; Telescope, which has remained in print since then.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Amateur_Astronomer</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 05:03:19 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
