Astronomers observe astronomical objects, such as stars, planets, moons, comets and galaxies â€“ in either observational (by analyzing the data) or theoretical astronomy. Examples of topics or fields astronomers study include planetary science, solar astronomy, the origin or evolution of stars, or the formation of galaxies. A related but distinct subject is physical cosmology, which studies the Universe as a whole.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 05:11:42 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
