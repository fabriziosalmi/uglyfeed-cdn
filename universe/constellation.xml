One of the fastest ships in the Navy, as proven by her victory during a battlegroup race held in 1985, she was nicknamed "Connie" by her crew and officially as "America's Flagship".
The contract to build Constellation was awarded to the New York Naval Shipyard on 1 July 1956, and her keel was laid down 14 September 1957 at the New York Navy Yard. She was christened and launched 8 October 1960, sponsored by Mary Herter (wife of Secretary of State Christian Herter). Constellation was delivered to the Navy 1 October 1961, and commissioned on 27 October 1961, with Captain T. J. Walker in command. At that time, she had cost about US$264.5 million. Constellation was the last conventional U.S. aircraft carrier (as of January 2021) to be built at a yard other than Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Company. Constellation was scrapped at Brownsville, Texas, in 2015â€“2017.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Constellation_(CV-64)</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 05:01:50 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
