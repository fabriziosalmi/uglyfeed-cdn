Constellation follows the modular but problematic littoral combat ships of the Freedom and Independence classes. The U.S. Navy announced the FFG(X) frigate project in the United States Department of Defense's Request For Information (RFI) in July 2017.
The Navy selected five shipbuilders to present their ideas for a prospective design for the proposed twenty FFG(X) guided-missile frigates. In April 2020, the Navy announced that Fincantieri Marinette Marine had won the contract with a modified design based on the Italian version of FREMM designed by Fincantieri. The project was later renamed FFG-62 program after the lead ship of her class.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation-class_frigate</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2025 05:02:06 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
