Its vast bulk – and main asterism viewed in most European cultures per Greco-Roman antiquity as a distant pair of fishes connected by one cord each that join at an apex – are in the Northern celestial hemisphere. Its old astronomical symbol is  (♓︎). Its name is Latin for "fishes". It is between Aquarius, of similar size, to the southwest and Aries, which is smaller, to the east. The ecliptic and the celestial equator intersect within this constellation and in Virgo. The Sun passes directly overhead of the equator, on average, at approximately this point in the sky, at the March equinox.
The right ascension/declination 00 is located within the boundaries of Pisces.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisces_(constellation)</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 05:10:38 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
