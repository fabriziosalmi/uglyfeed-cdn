Forty-one people died in the fire, and 116 others were injured, with 83 being treated for severe burns. Intensive care units in Valais reached capacity, and victims were transported to hospitals in other parts of Switzerland and to other European countries. A national day of mourning was observed on 9 January 2026 in memory of the victims.
Swiss authorities consider it likely that the ceiling caught fire after lit sparklers attached to champagne bottles were held aloft in celebration. A criminal investigation was opened against the bar's owners.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_Crans-Montana_bar_fire</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:28:41 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
