Under the tropical zodiac, the sun transits this sign between approximately November 22 and December 21. Greek mythology associates Sagittarius with the centaur Chiron, who mentored Achilles, a Greek hero of the Trojan War, in archery.
Sagittarius, the half human and half horse, is the centaur of mythology, the learned healer whose higher intelligence forms a bridge between Earth and Heaven. Also known as the Archer, Sagittarius is represented by the symbol of a bow and arrow.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_(astrology)</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 05:01:47 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
