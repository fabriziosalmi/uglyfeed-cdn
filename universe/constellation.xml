Constellation follows the modular but troubled littoral combat ships of the Freedom and Independence classes. The U.S. Navy announced the FFG(X) frigate project in the United States Department of Defense's Request For Information (RFI) in July 2017.
The Navy selected five shipbuilders to present their design concepts for a prospective class of up to twenty FFG(X) guided-missile frigates. In April 2020, the Navy announced that Fincantieri Marinette Marine had won the contract with a modified design based on the Italian version of FREMM designed by Fincantieri. The project was later renamed FFG-62 program after the lead ship of her class. The program was cancelled in November 2025, with only the first two ships already under construction to be finished and remaining four on order cancelled.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation-class_frigate</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 05:03:13 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
