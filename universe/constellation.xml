It is added to help imaging software detect the presence of such a document in a digital image. Such software can then block the user from reproducing such documents to prevent counterfeiting using color photocopiers.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EURion_constellation</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 05:02:01 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
