It is added to help imaging software detect the presence of such a document in a digital image.  Such software can then block the user from reproducing banknotes to prevent counterfeiting using colour photocopiers.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EURion_constellation</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2024 05:01:40 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
