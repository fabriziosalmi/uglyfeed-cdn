Its name is Latin for 'eagle' and it represents the bird that carried Zeus/Jupiter's thunderbolts in Greek-Roman mythology.
Its brightest star, Altair, is one vertex of the Summer Triangle asterism. The constellation is best seen in the northern summer, as it is located along the Milky Way. Because of this location, many clusters and nebulae are found within its borders, but they are dim and galaxies are few.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquila_(constellation)</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Oct 2024 05:01:47 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
