It spans the 150–180th degree of the zodiac. Under the tropical zodiac, the Sun transits this area between August 23 and September 22 on average. Depending on the system of astrology, individuals born during these dates may be called Virgos or Virgoans.
The sign is associated with Astraea, a figure from Greek mythology. Astraea was the last immortal to abandon Earth at the end of the Silver Age when the gods fled to Olympus, which is why Virgo is associated with Earth. Astraea later became the constellation of Virgo. Virgo is one of the three Earth signs, alongside Capricorn and Taurus.</description><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_(astrology)</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 05:01:53 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
