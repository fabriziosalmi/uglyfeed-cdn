# UglyFeed CDN

This repository acts as CDN for the [UglyFeed](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/UglyFeed) project.

You can find RSS content which is automatically generated by GitHub actions and python scripts. I use some of these XML feeds as source test feeds while testing UglyFeed updates and experiments. 

I want to automate as much as possible then I preferred the GitHub action approach (can be ported to Gitea and similar tools so quick). In addition I wanted to separate such content and the UglyFeed application code. This because a brand new repo.
