# UglyFeed CDN

This repository acts as CDN for the [UglyFeed](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/UglyFeed) project.

You can find RSS content which is automatically generated by GitHub actions and python scripts. I use some of these XML feeds as source test feeds while testing UglyFeed updates and experiments. 

I want to automate as much as possible then I preferred the GitHub action approach (can be ported to Gitea and similar tools so quick).

## Source feeds
Here you can find feeds intended to be used as source feeds for testing, These valid XML feeds are automatically updated on a daily basis. You can process them with [UglyFeed](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/UglyFeed) or any other RSS reader:

- [Happened today](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/uglyfeed-cdn/blob/main/happened-today/README.md)
- [Universe](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/uglyfeed-cdn/blob/main/universe/README.md)

> source content is retrieved by GitHub action using the `wikipedia` python package

_Please note that such content is intended just for testing the UglyFeed project and not as consistent RSS feed for end users._

## Processed feeds
Here you can find feeds intended to be evaluated as rewritten/generated by LLM feeds. These valid XML feeds are automatically updated on a daily basis. You can evaluate them with [UglyFeed](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/UglyFeed) metrics scripts or any other tool out there.
